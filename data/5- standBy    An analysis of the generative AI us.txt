An analysis of the generative AI use as analyst in qualitative research in science education

Abstract
The article evaluates the effectiveness of generative artificial intelligence models, specifically ChatGPT 4.0 and Claude 2.0, in conducting qualitative research within the field of scientific education. By applying the Cognitive Networks Mediation Theory (CNMT) to analyze interviews from two students, it was found that Claude 2.0 surpassed ChatGPT 4.0 in recognizing cognitive mediations and distinguishing between pre- and post-test conditions. Although both models concurred on the concept of conceptual evolution, Claude 2.0 demonstrated a greater capacity for detail, notably by referencing specific interview excerpts to support its analyses upon request. In contrast, ChatGPT 4.0 exhibited difficulties in these areas, even when given additional prompts. The study concludes by acknowledging the utility of AI, particularly Claude 2.0, for qualitative research, while also emphasizing the critical role of human oversight in detecting potential deficiencies within these models.

 Introduction
At  the  cusp  of  the  21st  century’s  third  decade,  the  increasing  development  of Information Technology (IT) has impacted the landscape of research methods in social sciences.This  researchfocuses  on  the  emergence and impact of  Generative  Artificial Intelligence  (GenAI)  platforms,  such  as  OpenAI’s ChatGPT  (OPENAI, 2022)  and Anthropic’s Claude(ANTHROPIC,  2023), in  the  development  of  qualitative  research. The  incorporation  ofITin education have  already  caused  remarkable  changes  (Bruun; Duka, 2018)in society. Similarly, the implementation of GenAI in tasks usually human-centeredis promising to impact different fields, such as qualitative data analysis.In  this  context, this  study  aims  to  explore  two  GenAI chatbots can  be  used in qualitative  studies alongside human  analysts,  specifically  withina Physics  education research analyzing students’ conceptual understanding.Through an innovative theoretical approach, we compared the performance of ChatGPT 4.0 and Claude 2.0in the analysis, aiming  to  comprehend  how  the  GenAI  can improve,  challenge  of  change  the  qualitive analysis methods.At the core of this exploration lies a central research question reminiscent of past academic endeavors(Belotto, 2018):How the GenAIcanenhance thehuman analysisin thedomain of qualitative research? Through this comparative analysis, we aim to explore the  emergingrole  of GenAI  in qualitative  research,  as  well  ascontribute  to the controversy regarding  the joint useof  technology  and  human outlookin academicresearch.2 Bibliographic ReviewGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly in the context of producing textual analysis, is an emerging field, especially within the realms of social sciences and humanities, which traditionally emphasize qualitative analysis. This trend began to gain momentum in 2023 with the popularization of ChatGPT. However, itis worth noting that computer  software  has  long  played  a  role  in  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  research(Santos;  Santos; Boss, 2023).  For  the  scope  of  this  paper,  a  SCOPUS  search  was conducted using the keywords “ChatGPT”and “qualitative analysis”. This yielded a total of 21 papers. Other databases, such as Google Scholar and ERIC, were excluded due to the return of diverse papers, including numerous preprints, opinion pieces, and editorials that had not undergone double-blind peer review. The criteria for inclusion and exclusion are as follows:Table 1: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the bibliographic search Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Full articles that mentioned in a searchable index the word ‘ChatGPT’ and ‘qualitative analysis’.•Articles that used the word ‘ChatGPT’ many times (5+) in the text, and actually dialogued with the context of LLMs.•Articles that only mentioned ChatGPT casually (1-2 times) and the paper was actually about another subject.•Editorials, Opinions, Letters, etc.•Pre-prints (no peer review).•Papers where the focus was ML pre-ChatGPT.•Papers that not dwell on qualitative analysis.So
