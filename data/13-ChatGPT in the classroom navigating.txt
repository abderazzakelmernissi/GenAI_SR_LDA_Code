Effective implementation of ChatGPT in management education requires addressing technical challenges and limitations. The emphasis should be on proper training and integration strategies to enable educators to fully leverage the capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT (Smith et al., 2019).

The guidance provided by ChatGPT was evidence-based, but the absence of cited sources made it unverifiable. Additionally, it was found to offer incorrect and incomplete information, which may require expert verification (Oviedo-Trespalacios et al., 2023). The product recommendations made by ChatGPT have implications for customers, as their decisions are influenced by them, highlighting the need for incorporating AI tools in online shopping (Kim et al., 2023; Lo, 2023).While ChatGPT serves as a source of quick and relevant data, it lacks the ability to think like a human being, raising concerns about the integrity of the information it provides (Vázquez-Cano et al., 2023).

Literature review and source citation remain critical issues in scientific writing using ChatGPT, as it provides sources with fabricated, non-existing titles. This may be attributed to a lack of training in ChatGPT for generating language models relevant to the query (Varghese and Chapiro, 2023). The results generated by ChatGPT are not consistently satisfactory across domains, and the information provided lacks consistency. It can be integrated into education by developing learning models and instructions (Alves de Castro et al., 2023). Generative AI technologies like ChatGPT offer opportunities for higher education, providing continuous access to information, personalized learning, learning experience support for instructors, and data analysis. However, they also pose challenges regarding ethical issues, integrity, transparency, accountability, and quality (Pisica et al., 2023; Michel-Villarreal et al., 2023).

3.3 Ethical concerns and application of ChatGPT
Human ethics is pivotal in the ethical use of generative AI tools in education, as highlighted by Heyder et al. (2023). Despite the benefits of personalized learning, ChatGPT raises ethical concerns and integrity issues, noted by Rasul et al. (2023). Educators, as emphasized by Benuyenah (2023), must assess ChatGPT's potential and challenges for thoughtful integration into educational processes. Despite hurdles like privacy concerns and regulatory gaps, Sabzalieva and Valentini (2023), suggests higher education institutions can utilize ChatGPT for teaching and research. While AI offers benefits like aiding in learning measurement and curriculum organization, there's limited research on its implications in higher education, requiring further exploration (Crompton and Burke, 2023; Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019). Wazan et al. (2023) suggest integrating generative AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance learning experiences. However, Bozkurt et al. (2021) stress considering ethical and privacy implications. Overall, ChatGPT's primary applications in education include teaching, assessment, research, and development (Wilfred and Ade-Ibijola, 2021).

Table 1 data shows that both Cronbach's Alpha coefficients (0.848 and 0.860) are relatively high indicates a robust level of internal consistency within the dataset's six items. These elevated Cronbach's Alpha values are positive indicators, suggesting that the set of items in the study is internally consistent. This reflects the reliability and quality of study measurement tool.

5. Results and discussion
Data analysis was conducted on information obtained through a structured questionnaire to derive results and corresponding interpretations for the purpose of study and future research. From the analysis of the data, it was determined that there were 157 female and 164 male participants in the survey. Given that the generative AI tool, ChatGPT, is in its early stages, the frequency of its usage by both students and faculty members is comparatively low. About 53% of students mentioned using it occasionally, while among faculty members, 44.2% expressed that they also use ChatGPT occasionally. Interestingly, among both faculty members and students, the majority (87.9%) indicated that they are not ready to purchase the premium version of ChatGPT.

5.1 Frequency of using ChatGPT
Table 2 displays the frequency of ChatGPT usage categorized by gender, occupation, and highest qualification. The majority of users from both genders employ ChatGPT occasionally, with 54% of females and 56% of males falling into this category. Doctoral program participants from both genders are the least frequent users. Chi-square tests for gender do not indicate a statistically significant relationship between gender and ChatGPT usage. The p-values for both the Pearson Chi-Square (“χ2”) and Likelihood Ratio (“G”) tests exceed the alpha level of 0.05, suggesting that gender has no statistically significant impact on ChatGPT usage.

There are six occupation categories: Faculty, Postgraduate (PG) Students, Undergraduate (UG) Students, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Commerce (BCOM), and Master of Business Administration (MBA). PG Students and UG Students, irrespective of their specific major, are the most frequent users of ChatGPT. Faculty members and Doctoral Program participants use ChatGPT less frequently. The chi-square tests for occupation also do not reveal a statistically significant relationship between occupation and ChatGPT usage, with p-values for both tests exceeding 0.05.

Qualifications range from BBA, BCOM, and MBA to Doctoral Program. Individuals with an MBA qualification are the most frequent users of ChatGPT, followed by those with a BCOM qualification. Doctoral Program participants use ChatGPT the least. In this case, the chi-square tests for the highest qualification indicate a statistically significant relationship between the highest qualification and ChatGPT usage. The p-values for both the Pearson Chi-Square ("χ2") and Likelihood Ratio ("G") tests are below 0.05, indicating that the highest qualification significantly influences ChatGPT usage.

In summary, the analysis suggests that while gender and occupation do not appear to have a significant impact on ChatGPT usage patterns, there is a statistically vital association between the highest qualifications attained by respondents and their frequency of using ChatGPT (Crompton and Burke, 2023). Further investigation may be needed to understand the reasons behind this association.

5.2 Intention behind using ChatGPT
The ranking and percentages reflect the diverse range of purposes for which users employ ChatGPT. It is notably valuable for academic-related tasks such as assignment writing, note preparation, and exploring new concepts, but it also serves functions like grammar checking and report writing. Additionally, it finds utility in language-related tasks such as translation and paraphrasing. ChatGPT has extensive applications as it can be used in higher education in many areas by both students and faculty members (Holmes and Tuomi, 2022) (see Figure 1).

5.3 Readiness to invest in a premium edition of ChatGPT
Table 3 presents the willingness to invest in a premium version, categorized by gender, occupation, and highest qualification. Among the 157 female respondents, 18 expressed a willingness to pay for the premium version, while 20 out of the 164 male respondents were open to the idea. Notably, the majority of respondents from both genders are not inclined to pay for the premium version. Chi-square tests for gender failed to reveal a significant association between gender and the willingness to pay. Both the “Pearson Chi-Square (χ2)” and “Likelihood Ratio tests (G)” yielded p-values exceeding 0.05, indicating that gender does not significantly impact the willingness to pay.

Among faculty members, 28 expressed interest in paying, while among PG students, 18 were willing to do so. Interestingly, UG students are the category least inclined to pay for the premium version.

The chi-square tests related to occupation revealed a statistically meaningful connection between occupation and the inclination to invest in the premium version. The p-values for both the Pearson Chi-Square and Likelihood Ratio tests fall below 0.05, indicating that occupation indeed exerts a substantial impact on the willingness to pay. Qualifications range from BBA, BCOM, and MBA to Doctoral Programs. Among these, individuals with MBA qualifications are the most inclined to pay for the premium version, followed by those with BCOM qualifications. Participants in Doctoral Programs exhibit the least willingness to pay.

Similarly, the chi-square tests concerning the highest qualification also establish a statistically significant link between qualification level and readiness to pay for the premium version. The p-values for both the Pearson Chi-Square and Likelihood Ratio tests are less than 0.05. In summary, the analysis suggests that while gender does not substantially impact the willingness to pay for a premium version, both occupation and highest qualification play a statistically significant role in influencing individuals' readiness to pay. Further research may be beneficial to understand the underlying factors behind these connections and to formulate targeted strategies for marketing premium versions of the product or service.

5.4 Factor analysis
The study uses factor analysis to understand how ChatGPT fits into management education by looking at different parts of the data. It helps answer the research questions by finding hidden patterns or groups in the data.

The KMO Measure Table 4 suggests that the dataset is suitable for factor analysis, and Bartlett's Test affirms the presence of substantial correlations among the variables, providing further justification for conducting factor analysis on the dataset.

Table 5 displays, Variables with higher commonalities, such as “AI Integration” (0.385), exhibit stronger relationships with the extracted factors, whereas variables like “Learning Enhancement” (0.269) have weaker associations with the extracted factors.

Table 6 provides detailed correlation analysis matrix, Critical Thinking demonstrates moderately strong positive correlations with Creativity (0.616), Learning Enhancement (0.772), and, to a lesser extent, Ethical Awareness (0.453). It exhibits weaker positive correlations with AI Integration (0.349) and Educator Guidance (0.279).

Similarly, Creativity displays a comparable pattern of moderately strong positive correlations with Critical Thinking (0.616), Learning Enhancement (0.765), and, to a lesser extent, Ethical Awareness (0.508). It also shows a weaker positive correlation with AI Integration (0.352) and Educator Guidance (0.280).

Ethical Awareness shows moderate positive correlations with Critical Thinking (0.453) and Creativity (0.508). It has a weaker positive correlation with AI Integration (0.406) and a somewhat stronger positive correlation with Educator Guidance (0.419).

AI Integration exhibits a moderate positive correlation with Learning Enhancement (0.709) but weaker positive correlations with Critical Thinking (0.349), Creativity (0.352), Ethical Awareness (0.406), and Educator Guidance (0.438).

Learning Enhancement demonstrates strong positive correlations with Critical Thinking (0.772) and Creativity (0.765). It also displays moderate positive correlations with Ethical Awareness (0.750) and AI Integration (0.709), along with a weaker positive correlation with Educator Guidance (0.506). Educator Guidance, in turn, shows weaker positive correlations with all other variables, with the highest correlation being 0.506 with Learning Enhancement.

This Inter-Item Correlation Matrix provides insights into how the variables in study dataset are related to one another. It suggests that Critical Thinking, Creativity, and Learning Enhancement are closely related, while Ethical Awareness, AI Integration, and Educator Guidance have weaker but still meaningful relationships with the other variables. These findings can assist researchers in understanding the patterns of association between these constructs and guide further analyses or the development of measurement instruments.

5.5 Hypothesis testing
As illustrated in Table 7, AI Integration and Critical Thinking (p label: 0.83): The high p label value of 0.83 indicates a robust positive relationship between “AI Integration” and “Critical Thinking.” This suggests that AI integration in a learning context is strongly associated with the development or enhancement of critical thinking skills. It's noteworthy that a p label value close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation.

AI Integration and Creativity (p label: 0.67): The p label value of 0.67 reflects a moderately positive relationship between “AI Integration” and “Creativity.” This implies that AI integration in education may moderately influence fostering creativity among learners. While the correlation is positive, it is not as robust as the correlation observed with critical thinking.

AI Integration and Ethical Awareness (p label: 0.67): Similar to creativity, “AI Integration” also exhibits a moderate positive relationship with “Ethical Awareness,” with a p label of 0.67. This suggests that the incorporation of AI (Rasul et al., 2023) in management educational settings may moderately contribute to raising awareness of ethical considerations in learning and technology.

Learning Enhancement and Critical Thinking (p label: 0.87): The high p label of 0.87 indicates a strong positive correlation between “Learning Enhancement” and “Critical Thinking.” This suggests that learning enhancement measures are strongly associated with the development or improvement of critical thinking skills among students (Farrokhnia et al., 2023).

Learning Enhancement and Creativity (p label: 0.57): “Learning Enhancement” has a positive correlation with “Creativity,” but the correlation is weaker compared to critical thinking, with a p label of 0.57. While it suggests a positive relationship, it may not be as impactful as critical thinking.

Educator Guidance and Ethical Awareness (p label: 0.56): “Educator Guidance” demonstrates a moderate positive correlation with “Ethical Awareness,” as indicated by a p label of 0.56. This implies that guidance from educators may moderately contribute to the development of ethical awareness among learners (Heyder et al., 2023). The above results suggest varying degrees of positive associations between items related to AI integration (Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019), learning enhancement, and specific skills or attributes. The strength of these associations can help educators and researchers gain a more comprehensive understanding of the potential influence of incorporating AI and improving learning approaches on critical thinking, creativity, and ethical consciousness in management educational environments (see Figure 2).

Considering the observed indices (Table 8 Model Fit Index Evaluation), it is evident that the Structural Equation Model (SEM) applied to the integration of ChatGPT in the classroom, specifically in navigating the generative AI wave within management education, exhibits commendable alignment with the dataset. The notable performance, as indicated by indices such as “Chi-Square/degrees of freedom (3.31), Goodness of Fit Index (0.92), Normed Fit Index (0.91), Comparative Fit Index (0.94), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (0.16),” affirms the model's proficiency in elucidating the underlying relationships in the data. It is essential to benchmark these values against established standards in the field of study, taking into consideration the specific research area and aims.

6. Findings and recommendations
The study shows that using ChatGPT in management education can make learning better and improve critical thinking skills. Even though some people worry about the ethics of using ChatGPT, many students and teachers use it for things like writing assignments and exploring ideas. It's interesting that how much ChatGPT is used varies between different groups of students and teachers. Undergraduates and postgraduates use it more than doctoral students and faculty members. This might be because different people have different ideas about ethics and what tasks they need help with. But, gender and job don't seem to make a big difference in how much ChatGPT is used. The study also found that when ChatGPT is used more, it helps students think critically and become more aware of ethical issues. To use ChatGPT well, teachers need to think about ethics and give students good guidance. It's important to keep checking how well ChatGPT and other AI tools are working and to be honest and responsible about using them. By doing this, management education can make the most of ChatGPT to make learning more interesting, helpful, and fair for everyone.
