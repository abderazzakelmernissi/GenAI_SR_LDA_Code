Changes and challenges of legal education in the era of generative artificial intelligence: Chinese experience

Abstract

Using generative artificial intelligence systems in the classroom for law case analysis teaching can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge delivery. They can create interactive learning environments that are appropriate, immersive, integrated, and evocative, guiding students to conduct case analysis from interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives. This teaching method not only increases students’ interest and participation in learning but also helps cultivate their interdisciplinary thinking and global vision. However, the application of generative artificial intelligence systems in legal education also faces some challenges and issues. If students excessively rely on these systems, their ability to think independently, make judgments, and innovate may be weakened, leading to over-trust in machines and reinforcement of value biases. To address these challenges and issues, legal education should focus more on cultivating students’ questioning skills, self-analysis abilities, critical thinking, basic legal literacy, digital skills, and humanistic spirit. This will enable students to respond to the challenges brought by generative artificial intelligence and ensure their comprehensive development in the new era.

1. Introduction  In the field of legal education, the application of generative artificial  intelligence systems poses new challenges to traditional educational methods,  concepts, and ecosystems. These systems revolutionized the original modes of  artificial intelligence technology, which were limited to indexed knowledge retrieval  and repetitive material paraphrasing, through interactive question-and-answer  knowledge responses and creative material combinations (Zhang, 2023). This  advancement not only further diminishes the role and value of objective knowledge  delivery in legal education but also signals a shift towards the core areas of legal  education that were previously inaccessible to analytical artificial intelligence, such  as the shaping of legal thinking and subjective value judgments. Facing the  transformative opportunities presented by generative artificial intelligence, it is  necessary to actively introduce these systems into legal education and summarize  relevant risks and response strategies through teaching practices. This will lay the  foundation for comprehensively improving the quality of legal education and  successfully cultivating legal talents who are adapted to the demands of the digital  technology era.  Currently, there are relatively few articles in China focusing on the impact of  generative artificial intelligence applications on legal education, while there is a relatively abundant amount of research on the impact of analytical artificial  intelligence on legal education and the overall impact of generative artificial  intelligence applications on education disciplines (Liu, 2020; Luo and Gao, 2020;  Liu, 2022; Xiao and Sun, 2023; Zhang and Pan, 2021). However, most of these  studies are still theoretical discussions without actually applying generative artificial  intelligence to classroom teaching practices, resulting in a disconnect between these  studies and teaching practices (Chen et al., 2023; Feng, 2023; Hua, 2021; Li, 2023;  Wang, 2023; Zhou and Li, 2023). Therefore, based on existing research, this article  aims to analyze the transformative opportunities and potential challenges faced by  legal education in the era of generative artificial intelligence, with a focus on case  analysis teaching practices using generative artificial intelligence. It also proposes  some feasible suggestions for future legal education.  2. Case selection and course design  Case teaching is crucial in legal education. Through the study and analysis of  typical cases, students can not only improve their skills in legal analysis and  argumentation, their ability to categorize and integrate facts, their mastery and  application of legal rules and principles, and their understanding of theoretical  knowledge involved in legal disputes but also cultivate their deep-level thinking  ability to “think like a lawyer” (Katherine, 2013). In the era of analytical artificial  intelligence, we have been able to address tasks in traditional legal education that  involve a certain degree of certainty and repetition, such as legal provision retrieval,  similar case searches, and doctrinal collation. Therefore, classrooms that simply  impart objective knowledge are no longer able to reflect the unique and  transformative impact that generative artificial intelligence may have on legal  education. However, in case analysis classrooms, the emergent capabilities of  generative artificial intelligence in knowledge generation, interactive  communication, value judgment, and contextual understanding can be better  demonstrated. Therefore, this study explores the use of generative artificial  intelligence in case teaching, aiming to deeply understand the beneficial changes and  practical challenges that generative artificial intelligence may bring to legal  education, and based on this, to propose appropriate suggestions for future reform  directions.  Therefore, we have selected ten cases, including the cave case, that are highly  typical, controversial, and influential both domestically and internationally,  reflecting different judicial cultures and ideologies of various legal systems. These  cases were chosen through a combination of recommendations from a generative  artificial intelligence system and teacher screenings, and we have embarked on  classroom teaching reform and experimentation using them, as shown in Table 1.  The course format is as follows: The teacher will first divide 24 students into  four groups, and the groups will analyze the selected cases through internal and  inter-group discussions. Before class, the teacher will require each group to negotiate  and select different perspectives to analyze and evaluate the controversial issues in  the cases. During class, each group will present their analysis of the relevant cases.  After the presentations, the teacher will briefly lecture on the fundamental concepts and knowledge systems related to the issues. Then, a classroom discussion will be  held, where students from each group will elaborate, ask questions, and provide  answers based on different viewpoints. Finally, the teacher will provide feedback on  the discussion and address any questions raised by the students, as shown in Figure  1.  Table 1. List of typical cases in China and Abroad.

Flowchart of classroom teaching.  The most significant difference between this case-based teaching and previous  ones lies in that during the group’s case reporting, evaluation, and debate, students  are allowed and encouraged to use ChatGPT and “Wenxin Yiyan” (a Chinese  artificial intelligence language model) systems as assistants and even directly use the  answers to questions obtained through appropriate methods during their presentations and discussions (Both ChatGPT and Wenxin Yiyan leverage the  advancements of artificial intelligence technology in the field of natural language  processing, but they have different objectives and functionalities. ChatGPT is  primarily used for conversational exchange, whereas Wenxin Yiyan is primarily  designed for generating textual content. ChatGPT places greater emphasis on the  fluency, logic, and interactivity of the conversation, while Wenxin Yiyan focuses  more on the creativity, completeness, and accuracy of the text).  3. The transformational significance of generative artificial  intelligence systems in legal case analysis courses  3.1. Transformation of information retrieval: Equality of knowledge  access and cognitive liberation  Although information technology has enabled students to access case  information, legal provisions, legal interpretations, similar case judgments, legal  doctrines, and social controversies more comprehensively and conveniently, this  content is often fragmented. Therefore, in previous case analysis teaching, the  cultivation of abilities such as how to use information resource libraries, how to find  laws, and how to grasp and analyze social public opinion remained the focus of  teaching and practice. Generative artificial intelligence, based on the original  analytical artificial intelligence, further enhances the simplicity, comprehensiveness,  and efficiency of case information retrieval, reducing the role and value of teachers  in standardized and objective knowledge transmission in legal education. This lays a  foundation for teachers to devote more energy to cultivating subjective speculative  content such as legal thinking, legal reasoning, and value judgment. Moreover, on  this basis, the application of generative artificial intelligence has been further  advanced: it can provide initial summaries of case dispute focuses, statistics on  similar related case information, and conclusions on the application of legal  provisions. This allows artificial intelligence to intervene and replace the logical,  reasoning, active, and subjective judgment tasks involved in the original case  analysis teaching, such as case deconstruction, legal application, and knowledge  point association. Such a more equal and standardized knowledge production model  quickly bridges the gap in abilities and levels between students with different  backgrounds, and even between students and teachers, in areas such as basic legal  knowledge, case analysis thinking, related case retrieval, and case dispute focusing.  It frees students from the need for cognitive resources and combination work  (Crawford et al., 2023; Y. Zhang et al., 2023). This can achieve the so-called  cognitive equality, which means that in terms of legal fundamentals and the  acquisition and mastery of objective knowledge, students and teachers can equally  access them through artificial intelligence, thus eliminating the original knowledge  inequality. Cognitive equality will help achieve the goal of cognitive liberation. The  integration effect of knowledge and information brought about by generative  artificial intelligence greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of classroom  knowledge instruction, while also helping teachers shift more teaching focus to  cultivating students’ critical thinking skills, logical reasoning abilities, foresight, and ability to dig into details. This can further liberate and expand students’ cognitive  abilities, enhancing the depth, breadth, and dimensions of their legal thinking.  3.2. Creation of instructional context: Process sorting and role  engagement  The process of case analysis is not only a reactivation and integration of  existing legal knowledge, but also a means to comprehensively enhance students’  abilities in pruning case facts, establishing dispute focuses, understanding legislative  purposes, resolving case disputes, and clarifying case procedures. To achieve this, it  is necessary to encourage deeper participation, clear direction, and sustained  dialogue during the analysis and discussion of cases. In the case of teaching,  generative artificial intelligence systems can facilitate the sorting of case processes  and immersive scenarios through methods such as fact sorting, role setting, multiround dialogue, and environmental creation, thereby creating an interactive learning  environment that is appropriate, immersive, integrated, and evocative.  On the one hand, generative artificial intelligence systems can comprehensively  enhance the intuitiveness, immersion, and clarity of case teaching by optimizing case  resolution processes (Table 2), summarizing case mind maps (Figures 2 and 3) (The  generation of the mind map adopts the following method: Wenxin Yiyan generates a  text-based mind map structure, and then the relevant text is copied into the mind  mapping software Xmind, which automatically generates the mind maps listed in this  article), and targeting the collation of theoretical resources. Through guided  construction, generative artificial intelligence can summarize the dispute focuses of  cases, indicate the analysis process, and construct argumentation models for different  assertions, thereby stimulating students’ interest in learning, standardizing the  direction of problem discussion, clarifying the scope of knowledge application, and  organizing knowledge hierarchies.

Mind map of Sichuan Luzhou Inheritance Case.  On the other hand, the creation of teaching scenarios is another crucial approach  in case teaching, especially when it requires students to experience different roles in  case discussions. This can help students comprehensively grasp the thinking and  strategies that different parties should adopt in resolving cases. Generative artificial  intelligence, with its powerful capabilities in contextual learning, chain-of-thought  reasoning, and multi-round dialogue, can set up dialogue scenarios to engage  students in continuous conversations from different roles, thus providing them with  diversified and personalized case-handling solutions, defense documents, judicial  documents, etc. (Sang and Yu, 2023). For instance, in teaching the trolley problem  case, we asked students to analyze and debate the case using a generative artificial  intelligence system from the perspectives of a judge, prosecutor, defendant, victim,  and defense attorney. From the teaching perspective, this approach not only  enhances students’ sense of participation and immersion but also trains their ability  to interpret cases comprehensively and resolve them diversely, laying a solid  foundation for improving their practical litigation skills and communication  techniques throughout the entire process. Moreover, due to the differences in prompting subjects, the emergence of knowledge capabilities, and the individuality  of dialogue context construction, even the same generative artificial intelligence  system may produce varying answers to the same question. Such information output  provides more angles for analysis and reflection in case discussion courses, further  opening up topic discussions, fostering collisions of ideas, expanding knowledge  scopes, and comprehensively enhancing students’ innovative thinking.  3.3. Examination from multiple perspectives: Interdisciplinary and crosscultural reflection  The integration and output of knowledge by generative artificial intelligence  systems are not constrained by a single discipline or a single answer. Instead, they  provide interdisciplinary and cross-cultural answers based on different question-and-answer contexts. On the one hand, the conclusions provided by generative artificial  intelligence are not limited to a single legal theory, but offer different perspectives  based on various schools of thought such as economic law, positivist jurisprudence,  sociological jurisprudence, and analytical jurisprudence. In case analyses, generative  artificial intelligence systems also take into account the differences in legal culture,  judicial systems, and judicial philosophies encountered in different domestic and  international cases. This allows the system to selectively focus on the theoretical  perspectives that are most relevant to the cultural background of each case. On the  other hand, the responses are not confined to the field of law alone. They also draw  from multiple disciplines, including statistics, sociology, psychology, ethics, and  political science, to provide theoretical support for different case verdicts. This  approach undoubtedly breaks down the invisible disciplinary barriers inherent in  traditional legal education, avoiding issues such as a singular knowledge catalog, a  flat knowledge system, and outdated content. Furthermore, a multidisciplinary  perspective helps students analyze problems and construct rule systems from  multiple standpoints, including policy, law, and ethics. This fosters complementarity  between academic knowledge, crossover of academic and practical abilities,  extension of legal thinking, and systematization of cognitive methodologies. It holds  positive significance in nurturing high-end interdisciplinary talents with integrated  thinking (Wang et al., 2022; Wang and Liu, 2023).  Furthermore, due to differences in the training databases, different types of  generative artificial intelligence systems can demonstrate the disparities between  different legal and historical cultures in their analysis of the same case. For instance,  in teaching, we have observed that Baidu’s Wenxin Yiyan system tends to adopt a  conciliatory mindset when responding to similar questions, offering multiple  solutions while avoiding over-emphasis on a single approach. In contrast, ChatGPT,  developed by OpenAI, often exhibits a preference for economical and efficient  solutions in its responses. This bears similarities to the differences between Chinese  and American legal cultures. For instance, in discussions about the trolley problem,  students using Wenxin Yiyan often adopt a conciliatory viewpoint. This is because,  even when students explicitly ask the generative artificial intelligence system to  provide a definitive choice and supporting reasons, Wenxin Yiyan still tends to add  additional information pointing out that the other choice should also be understood, along with relevant supporting reasons. Moreover, in case handling, for domestic  cases, the judgments and reasons provided by the Wenxin Yiyan system tend to be  closer to the thinking and conclusions of real-life case handling, while ChatGPT  demonstrates corresponding advantages when dealing with foreign cases. The  collision of diverse legal cultural knowledge has a positive impact on motivating  students to actively understand the differences between different legal cultures and  the underlying generative logic behind them. Through comparison, students gain a  more vivid and profound understanding of legal issues, reflection on controversial  viewpoints, and the influence of social backgrounds on legal culture.  4. The practical dilemma of applying generative artificial  intelligence systems in legal case analysis courses  4.1. Weakening of student autonomy  Through empirical analysis of over 3000 students at Berkeley School of Law  and Hastings College of the Law, Shultz and Zedeck (2011) concluded that  noncognitive abilities have a more profound impact on students’ future legal careers  than cognitive abilities such as UGPA, LAST, and 1LGPA (grade point average in  the first year). The autonomy mentioned in this article refers to students’ noncognitive abilities such as independent thinking, decision-making, analytical  judgment, and open innovation in case studies. In classroom teaching, we have found  that the use of generative artificial intelligence systems is gradually eroding these  abilities among students.  Firstly, because generative artificial intelligence can provide accurate, coherent,  and readable knowledge content in a short period of time, it means that during the  process of analyzing cases, the process of students searching for, reading,  understanding, and mastering basic concepts, legal provisions, similar cases, and  other related knowledge is replaced or simplified, and the time required is shortened.  This can lead to a lack of motivation for students to conduct in-depth and detailed  analysis of cases and comprehensive and deep reflection on controversies. As a  result, some controversies often remain superficial and fail to touch the core of the  dispute and the ontology of relevant legal knowledge, further affecting the depth of  classroom discussions. The lack of cognition, understanding, and mastery of basic  knowledge undoubtedly reduces the systematicness and balance of students’  knowledge application, knowledge production, and cognitive methods, making it  impossible for them to accurately and flexibly understand and apply the law under  changing case conditions (Sun and Shen, 2024).  Secondly, the key difference between generative artificial intelligence and other  intelligent systems lies in its ability to continuously adjust parameters and  knowledge combinations based on relevant prompts and dialogue contexts through  multi-round open conversations and feedback learning, thereby continuously  revising the output content. Although this dialogue approach disrupts the traditional  mode in legal education where intelligent systems merely provide discrete  knowledge resource indices or lists for teachers and students, enabling continuous  feedback, follow-up, clarification, and innovative combinations of knowledge, this innovative way of generating case-handling conclusions undoubtedly increases  students’ dependency on the judicial conclusions and thinking derived from  generative artificial intelligence systems, gradually weakening their critical,  interpretive, and extension thinking needed to handle cases, and further solidifying  their fixed-mindset approaches. For instance, while students may agree with the  principle that “no one should profit from their illegal actions” in the case of “Riggs  v. Palmer” and extend it to the “Luzhou Inheritance Case in Sichuan” to arrive at the  concept that “no one should profit from their immoral actions,” in the teaching  process, once elements such as the caregiver’s meticulous daily care for the decedent  and the notarization of the relevant will are introduced, many students find it difficult  to reasonably handle the relevant case facts by extending their argumentative  thinking or changing their position.  Thirdly, the application of generative artificial intelligence hinders students  from exercising creative thinking in solving cases. Creative thinking comes from the  combination of knowledge, curiosity, and imagination (Qian, 2018). Although the  answers provided by the generative artificial intelligence system may vary depending  on the way the question is asked and the combination of knowledge used. Due to the  consistency of the system’s operational logic and the learned database, the core  answers of the generative artificial intelligence system to the same question have a  high degree of internal consistency. However, the roughly same answer output can  easily cause students to consume a lot of energy on homogenized content in group  discussions and classroom discussions, thereby reducing the curiosity and  imagination generated by the collision of different viewpoints, and also reducing the  spillover effect of unstable expectations. For example, in classroom discussions  about the conflict between morality and law in the four cases of Kunshan  Counterattack Case, Luzhou Bequest Case, Antigone, and the Cave Mystery, the  generative artificial intelligence almost always gives the same answer: “Related  issues are complex and controversial, and should be considered from multiple  perspectives based on specific circumstances.” This has led students to often hold a  dialectical thinking and philosophy when discussing these issues, unable to take a  clear-cut stand from a single perspective, thus affecting the depth of discussion and  eliminating more possibilities for colliding viewpoints.  The rule of law is governance based on reason and speculation, and legal  education needs to focus on cultivating students’ independent judgment and  innovative thinking. This will enable students to comprehensively examine the  cultural traditions, social backgrounds, and justice demands implied behind case  disputes when faced with situations such as rule vacuums, conflicts, ambiguity, and  conflicts between rule application and current social justice concepts. It will also  allow them to exercise creative thinking to optimize defense strategies, update legal  concepts, and respond to social demands (Chen and Lv, 2020). However, the use of  generative artificial intelligence reduces students’ substantial participation in case  analysis, potentially leading to issues of “empty talkism” under technological  dominance (Wu et al., 2023). 

4.2. The avoidance and misguidance of value choices  How to face and resolve new, complex, and difficult cases is a crucial aspect of  both academic and practical thinking for law students. When dealing with such  cases, the simple approach of merely piecing together legal provisions with factual  elements often fails, necessitating a comprehensive utilization of various legal  methods and legal thinking to engage in value judgments. While generative artificial  intelligence has overcome the limitations of traditional analytical artificial  intelligence in terms of value judgments, it still faces issues of avoidance and  misguidance in value choices when analyzing specific cases.  On one hand, to avoid excessive strict regulation and public panic, there is often  a strong emphasis on political correctness and value recognition in the construction  and testing of generative artificial intelligence. However, such standardized settings  do not provide substantial and helpful solutions for value disputes in cases. While  this approach of avoiding intervention in value disputes significantly reduces the risk  of generative artificial intelligence outputting toxic, harmful information and adverse  values, it often results in ambiguous and “correct but useless” value judgment  solutions for cases that require value measurement and choice. This not only lacks  guiding value for case resolution but also contradicts the principle that real judicial  cases must provide solutions to problems (judges must make decisions) (The  principle of ‘judges must not refuse to adjudicate’ has become a fundamental  principle recognized and adhered to as a judicial common sense by the majority of  countries and regions in the world (Fan, 2020). In cases such as the Luzhou Bequest  Case in Sichuan and the Riggs v. Palmer case, some students may ask generative  artificial intelligence to rule that a will is valid. However, before reaching a valid  conclusion, the generative artificial intelligence may add a statement like “If the will  does not violate public order and good customs, then it can be considered valid.”  Additionally, it may attach a comment such as “It is also necessary to consider the  influence of public opinion and moral concepts on the case, seeking a balance  between respecting the law, safeguarding social and public interests, and respecting  the wishes of the testator, to ensure that the verdict is fair, legal, and reasonable.”  While such an answer may seem to have no value issues on the surface, it actually  does not provide genuine and helpful advice for reaching a conclusion in the case.  After students are exposed to this type of value processing method excessively, they  may also encounter problems of vagueness or idling in debates on case value  disputes. Such a way of thinking can seriously weaken their ability to think and  resolve related issues after they start practicing.  On the other hand, the use of generative artificial intelligence in case-based  teaching also presents implicit issues of value bias. Studies have shown that, due to  the influence of training data, ChatGPT’s responses exhibit implicit discrimination  or stereotypical tendencies, resulting in unfair predictions and evaluations towards  individuals such as disabled persons, ethnic minorities, and impoverished  populations (Zhuo et al., 2023). Influenced by the developers’ objectives, designers  can steer ChatGPT to generate programs that determine whether to accept job  applicants based on factors such as gender, region, and race during its development  and usage (Choi, 2023). Similar issues are inevitable in legal education. Subject to the influence of different linguistic cultures, legal cultures, and network data,  generative artificial intelligence may implicitly incorporate consensus-based value  biases from various linguistic and cultural datasets when providing answers to case  analysis (Omiye et al., 2023). Additionally, in question-and-answer learning, if some  students have preferential value choices and continuously guide and prompt the  generative artificial intelligence system, the system may adapt to the role and cater to  the users’ preferences, resulting in the system outputting more academic viewpoints  and judging tendencies that align with the students’ value preferences. This can  further exacerbate the students’ original stereotyped value choices. For instance, in  scenarios such as the cave case and the trolley problem, some students adhere to the  belief that life is invaluable and should not be quantified. This belief even carries  over into discussions about the Kunshan counter-killing case, where they base their  arguments on this concept and demand that generative artificial intelligence provide  supporting arguments. Consequently, during classroom discussions, they argue that  even if the requirements for legitimate defense are met, excessive measures should  not be taken to deprive the aggressor of their life. notations in debates on case value  disputes. Such thinking patterns can severely weaken their ability to think and  resolve related issues after entering the profession.  4.3. The misleading issue of false and misleading information  Currently, there exists a serious issue of misleading outputs of false and  erroneous information in generative artificial intelligence. This issue mainly  manifests in the following three aspects: firstly, the problem of generating fictitious  information (W. X. Zhang et al., 2023). Secondly, the issue of generating and  disseminating erroneous information is also known as the problem of “speaking  nonsense with a serious tone” (Fang and Tang, 2023). Thirdly, the problem of  generating and spreading misleading and inflammatory information (Deshpande et  al., 2023). The reasons for this issue lie in several factors. On one hand, generative  artificial intelligence follows the generation logic of meaning matching and  calculates text generation through the method of maximum probability. However,  actions based on probability cannot comprehend the practical significance of the  generated content, thus making it difficult to guarantee the authenticity of the content  (Park et al., 2023). On the other hand, most of the pre-training data for generative  artificial intelligence comes from the internet (Table 3). Due to the lack of effective  data auditing, strict data supervision, and robust data cleaning mechanisms, these  internet data inevitably contain false, discriminatory, violent, illegal, and  unstructured information (Zhao et al., 2023). During the pre-training process, the  generative artificial intelligence system is inevitably influenced by these data,  resulting in the generation of information that violates the requirements of  authenticity and objectivity.  Despite the evident issues of generating false and erroneous information,  students, in the long-term use of related systems, are still susceptible to factors such  as “conformity,” “cognitive miserliness,” and “responsibility isolation mindset.”  These factors can lead to a dependency mindset and even unconditional trust in the  answers provided by generative artificial intelligence (Busch and Henriksen, 2018; Linda et al., 1999). Scholars have summarized this phenomenon, stating that “due to  factors such as trusted automation logic, lack of time, pursuit of convenience, and  avoidance of responsibility, even when explicitly recognizing that automation  systems are merely auxiliary tools and their decision-making content is unreliable,  people still tend to trust the instructions they provide” (Skitka et al., 2011).

Table 3. Main network data sources of partially generative artificial intelligence system.  Name of generative artificial intelligence Main source of network data  GPT-4 Common Crawl, WebText 2, Wikipedia  Wenxin Yiyan Web pages, Blogs, Forums, Wikipedia, and social media content  LLaMa Stack Exchange, Common Crawl, C4, Github, arXiv  Palm Github, multilingual Wikipedia, and conversation information from social media  Such issues arise specifically in the classroom learning process. Through a  survey of students’ attitudes towards the review of information generated by  generative artificial intelligence systems across different weeks of teaching (Table  4). In the initial stages, students generally had a low level of trust in the answers  provided by generative artificial intelligence for case discussion questions. Most  students would carefully review the information output by the system. However, as  time progressed, this situation gradually changed, with students’ trust in the relevant  information continuously increasing. In the end, approximately one-third of the  students only reviewed the key content, while another one-third no longer carefully  discriminated against the information provided by the generative artificial  intelligence system. Even when they were explicitly informed of the problem of  inaccurate information output by the system, many students had already discovered  issues with information biases in the early stages of their learning.  Table 4. Statistical table of students’ attitudes towards the censorship of information  generated by generative artificial intelligence.  Teaching week Carefully censor Focused censorship No censorship  12 3 4  22 18 15 11  14 7 9  12 2 4  Through a survey of students who have completely trusted the information  output by generative artificial intelligence (Table 5), we found that the majority of  them mentioned that verifying the content of the system’s output requires a  significant amount of time, which may even exceed the time saved by using the  artificial intelligence system. This is contrary to the original intention of employing  generative artificial intelligence systems. Many students also expressed that since the  answers provided by the system are closer to academic language expression and can  offer abundant materials as support, they tend to unconsciously develop a  dependency mindset, given that the machine possesses more database knowledge  than students. Additionally, in the specific analysis of cases, the phenomenon of responsibility isolation serves as a crucial factor that discourages students from  further verification. Even when pointed out for biases in summarizing case facts,  applying legal provisions, or citing legal interpretations, they justify it by claiming  that these biases stem from the machine’s conclusions, not their own. This reduces  the psychological burden students may feel when applying incorrect information.  Table 5. Statistical table of reasons why students did not conduct censorship in the  last week.  Trust the machine No need to be responsible Lack of time Pursuit of convenience Others  4 3 45 2  However, legal case analysis is a highly rigorous, meticulous, and realistic task.  Even if there are minor errors in the output of generative artificial intelligence after  optimization, students’ recognition and trust in relevant information without  discrimination violate the pursuit of fairness and justice and may have a significant  adverse impact on the personal and property safety of the parties involved in the  case. Therefore, we must help students recognize this issue and strive to overcome  the risk of over-trusting machines brought by the application of generative artificial  intelligence systems.  4.4. The direction of reform for legal case analysis courses in the era of  generative artificial intelligence systems  With its powerful natural language processing capabilities and autonomous  information generation abilities, it has become a trend for generative artificial  intelligence to be fully integrated into daily work, life, entertainment, scientific  research, and other activities. However, it also brings about divisions in knowledge  systems, the interconnectedness of knowledge and power, as well as the infiltration  of technological knowledge (Foucault, 2012). For legal education, generative  artificial intelligence has further emphasized the teaching methods and educational  philosophy that, “Thinking is more important than knowledge, questions are more  important than answers, and logic is more important than enumeration” (Shen and  Zhu, 2023). Facing the trend of generative artificial intelligence catalyzing a new  “teacher-machine-student” teaching model and accelerating “human-machine  collaboration” learning, we should appropriately adapt the forms, models, concepts,  and directions of legal education to respond to the challenges and demands posed by  the application of generative artificial intelligence to legal education (Zheng et al.,  2024).  4.5. Ability cultivation shift: From solving problems to posing questions  Since generative artificial intelligence possesses learning capabilities in  interactive dialogues, it adjusts its output preferences based on human annotations  and reward models. Therefore, during the process of interacting with the generative  artificial intelligence system, the user’s questioning logic, methods, output content,  and preference settings not only affect the quality of information obtained from the  system, but also influence the system’s information preferences, thinking patterns, and interactive capabilities to a certain extent. It has been demonstrated that the  better the questions posed, the higher the quality of answers received, and the more  conducive it is to improve the system’s natural language understanding and  information output capabilities.  For legal education, the extraction of problem keywords, the sorting of  problem-solving steps, and the positioning of roles in case handling need to be  further integrated with the characteristics of generative artificial intelligence  question-answering models, the operational logic of programming, and the  understanding of role settings. Therefore, beneficial guidance and effective  questioning will directly affect the quality of answers provided by the generative  artificial intelligence system and the degree of system optimization. To ensure  optimal answers during the human-machine interaction process, it is necessary to  focus on cultivating students’ ability to ask questions.  On one hand, it is essential to strengthen the cultivation of students’ ability to  structurally sort and hierarchically decompose relevant controversial issues implicit  in cases. Enhancing students’ abilities in case module decomposition, controversy  hierarchy slicing, causality arrangement, knowledge graph mapping, and other  layered, step-by-step, and categorical skills can help them improve the coherence,  hierarchy, and logic of their questioning methods. This can better guide generative  AI to gradually understand the asker's advanced thinking and reasoning chain,  accurately perceive the asker's intention, process a set of instructions coherently, and  imitate the structured thinking process of human case handling, thereby realizing the  visualization of the process of generative AI case handling (Zhao et al., 2024).  On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen students’ understanding and  learning of digital thinking and computer programming logic languages. Although  the application of generative artificial intelligence and its multimodal access, backed  by powerful natural language understanding and interaction capabilities, enables  users without programming knowledge to communicate instructions to machines  without obstacles, the machine merely replaces the step of converting natural  language into a programming language. However, when understanding and  processing related issues, the artificial intelligence system still follows programming  thinking and logic. Therefore, we should attach importance to cultivating the  mathematical and logical thinking of law students, guiding them to provide clearer  instructions, construct a clearer context, decompose complex tasks more reasonably,  accurately set dialogue roles and styles, and improve the iteration of relevant  prompts languages during human-machine interactions. the success of generative  artificial intelligence case handling (Zhao et al., 2024).  4.6. Enhancement of autonomy: Transition from passive acceptance to  active judgment  Addressing the issue of the decline in student autonomy due to the application  of generative artificial intelligence systems, Crompton and Ren (2023) pointed out  that in the face of the loss of students’ autonomous thinking, teachers should  embrace generative artificial intelligence and guide students to shift from passive to  active roles, becoming discerning knowledge consumers and proactive learners who can master ChatGPT. In the context of legal education, generative artificial  intelligence not only provides content such as case indexes, legal provisions, and  legal interpretations, but also cites the views of scholars or schools of thought, and  even proposes case judgments based on weighted analysis of factors. To avoid  excessive weakening of student autonomy and the formation of fixed thinking  patterns, it is not only necessary to cultivate students’ ability to understand relevant  judgments and academic views based on the background of cases but also to  cultivate their ability to engage in dissenting arguments, logical construction, and  deep thinking based on theoretical thinking, logical reasoning, gap filling, legal  argumentation, and legal reasoning.  In legal education, to cultivate students’ autonomous analytical skills, we  should neither neglect the objective knowledge provision, analytical process  guidance, and basic conclusion judgment brought by generative artificial intelligence  nor blindly follow it. Therefore, it is advisable to advocate a combination of humans  and machines, but require students to independently review the content during  classroom teaching and after-class practice. For instance, students can be allowed to  use generative artificial intelligence to generate basic frameworks and sentences  based on prompts such as questions, viewpoints, ideas, and intentions. The  application of artificial intelligence systems in students’ discussions and assignments  to provide simulated data and analytical conclusions is also permissible.  Additionally, generative artificial intelligence can be used to provide case referrals,  academic viewpoint summaries, and guidance on key points of adjudication.  However, after these suggestions are made, it is still necessary for students to review,  screen, revise, and confirm the content (Ren, 2023). Such an application of  generative artificial intelligence not only ensures its positive role in legal education  but also enhances students’ autonomous analytical and judgment skills. Technically,  we can develop and improve generative artificial intelligence systems capable of  outputting watermarked outputs to avoid students’ over-reliance on artificial  intelligence systems and reluctance to actively review relevant content (Zhu and  Yang, 2023).  Furthermore, it is necessary to strengthen the cultivation of justice value  concepts as well as the ability to critically question and reflect. Apart from  knowledge education, value education plays a significant role in legal education,  particularly in the context of insufficient value argumentation and potential value  misguidance in generative artificial intelligence. Reinforcing fundamental value  education in legal education regarding fairness, justice, freedom, democracy, and  other principles is particularly crucial. In case-based teaching, teachers need to fully  guide students in exploring the challenges posed by relevant disputes behind difficult  and complex cases to the predictability, inclusiveness, stability, and acceptability of  the law. On one hand, this involves cultivating students’ thinking in legal  interpretation, legal development, and legal transplantation, thereby guiding them to  correctly apply value selection methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to  comprehensively enhance students’ ability to transfer knowledge and respond to  social justice demands, thus cultivating their capacity to make acceptable and  predictable decisions in case handling. 

4.7. The return to basics: Enhancing the ability of knowledge  presentation and knowledge restoration  Neither the ability to judge the legality, rationality, and correctness of the output  from generative artificial intelligence nor the creative and open-minded thinking in  actively handling complex cases based on case needs and legal interpretation skills  arise out of nowhere. Although it can be reasonably assumed that graduate students  in law possess a certain foundation of legal knowledge and legal thinking for case  analysis courses, we have observed a noticeable decline in students’ attitudes and  ability to grasp and retain basic knowledge due to the influence of technologies such  as mobile internet and artificial intelligence. The tolerance of generative artificial  intelligence technology in classrooms has further reduced students’ motivation to  consolidate, review, and memorize relevant basic knowledge. Although the  application of generative artificial intelligence may exacerbate the difficulty in  cultivating basic legal knowledge and skills, it does not negate the fundamental role  of these basics in shaping students’ overall quality. This underscores the need for  legal education to focus on overcoming students’ dependence on digital systems and  strengthening and optimizing their basic legal literacy education.  On the one hand, in the era of generative artificial intelligence, it is still  necessary to emphasize the importance of strengthening the cultivation of students’  knowledge presentation abilities, such as information discrimination, data  organization, structural analysis, logical reasoning, and written expression. The  reasons are threefold. Firstly, generative artificial intelligence systems cannot  independently verify the quality and accuracy of learning data, nor can they validate  every generated result (Yang, 2023). This places higher demands on students’ basic  literacy, requiring them to lay a solid foundation in their studies and possess keen  abilities in information review, discrimination, and reorganization. By doing so, they  can ensure their autonomy in learning and reduce the risk of information  misguidance caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence. Secondly,  generative artificial intelligence models have great potential for training and  application in the vertical field of law, thus providing students with new employment  opportunities as algorithm model trainers. To meet the demands of model training  and fine-tuning, students must possess solid basic literacy in law. Finally, cultivating  students’ abilities to present knowledge in a structured, logical, and standardized  manner will help them continuously optimize the quality of datasets in the  application and production cycle of legal data. This is an important guarantee for  further enhancing the professionalism and accuracy of generative artificial  intelligence systems and fostering a beneficial ecosystem for system application and  optimization.  On the other hand, the systematic development of knowledge presentation  abilities, such as writing expression and information organization, requires the  support of knowledge restoration abilities. For legal research and practice, innovative  thinking and empathy thinking do not arise spontaneously. Instead, they require  students to extend and expand their understanding based on the existing knowledge  system and knowledge production patterns. Over-reliance on generative artificial  intelligence systems while completely neglecting the cultivation of basic knowledge
may lead to mental inertia and a void in knowledge utilization (Zhang, 2023). Only  when students can understand the implicit knowledge occurrence scenarios,  knowledge construction paths, and knowledge generation purposes behind different  legal theories and case handling methods can they effectively respond to the  leapfrogging of the generative artificial intelligence over the process of legal  knowledge generation and penetrate the black box of algorithm systems’ efficiencyoriented and single-answer outputs. Therefore, in the teaching process, teachers need  to pay more attention to restoring the knowledge generation process overlooked by  generative artificial intelligence. Through logical deduction of the legal knowledge  system, specific presentation of legal knowledge content, tracing the original  meanings of legal concepts, and gradual deduction of causal chains, teachers can  train students’ inductive and participatory abilities. This process is not only an  experience of the inherent laws of legal knowledge, but also a cultivation of  students’ abilities to discover, explore, and construct thinking.  4.8. Cultivating digital literacy: Enhancing both digital skills and  humanistic spirit  In the face of the comprehensive digital reform of society and education, as well  as the new challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence to legal education, it  is necessary to comprehensively cultivate students’ digital literacy to adapt to the  new changes and requirements brought by the digital era for the study of legal  knowledge and the cultivation of legal thinking. For law students, the focus of  cultivating digital literacy lies in their abilities in digital discrimination and digital  technology application.  Firstly, it is necessary to cultivate students to transform from mere users of  generative artificial intelligence systems into rational cognizers of the operational  logic, inherent limitations, and impacts on the autonomy of generative artificial  intelligence technology. When applying generative artificial intelligence systems to  the teaching of legal knowledge and case analysis, it is essential to add lectures on  relevant knowledge of artificial intelligence to help students dialectically view the  impact of generative artificial intelligence technology on legal learning and practice.  Secondly, it is important to cultivate students’ ability to distinguish and screen  information provided by generative artificial intelligence. In legal education, this  means cultivating students’ ability to find and identify authoritative information  sources, identify biases in the understanding of cases and legal provisions by  generative artificial intelligence systems, discern invalid value judgments, and  efficiently identify the authenticity of information during teaching.  Lastly, it is crucial to cultivate students’ ability to maintain independent  thinking through communication and criticism when faced with information cocoons  constructed by continuous conversational information flows from generative  artificial intelligence. This requires guiding students to clearly understand the  limitations of machine-dependent thinking when applying generative artificial  intelligence in legal classroom teaching, and encouraging them to analyze and debate  controversial issues or case focal points from different perspectives.  Furthermore, strengthening the cultivation of students’ humanistic spirit and enhancing their ability to respond to social justice demands, as well as their  sensitivity to common sense, emotions, and rationality, and their appreciation for the  compassionate aspect of the law, is another crucial aspect of avoiding students being  influenced by the mechanical justice concepts of generative artificial intelligence  systems. When facing novel, difficult, and hot cases in complex scenarios, social and  emotional competence, such as moral pursuits, empathy, and sympathy, serve as an  important guarantee for upholding the value of fairness and justice in legal research  and practice (Zhou and Wang, 2023). Therefore, during the teaching process,  teachers should pay attention to identifying and diluting the standardized and  quantitative thinking followed by generative artificial intelligence systems, and focus  on cultivating students’ humanistic literacy and cultural connotation (Liu and Wang,  2023). Specifically, this means guiding students to practice moral rationality in value  disputes, adhere to mainstream values in conflicts between law and reason, and  respect cultural diversity in conflicts between multiple ideologies. It also helps  students fully utilize their conscience, sense of justice, empathy, and compassion to  engage in situational imagination and emotional integration when facing  controversial and metaphorical cases involving value conflicts, ethical disputes, and  class antagonisms (Chen and Wang, 2024). Only in this way can the significance and  value of the humanistic spirit be fully realized after generative artificial intelligence  becomes fully involved in legal research and application.  5. Conclusion  Based on the reform practice of applying generative artificial intelligence  systems to the teaching of legal case courses, this article systematically explores the  potential positive and negative impacts of generative artificial intelligence on legal  education. On the positive side, the application of generative artificial intelligence  can enhance the quality of classroom teaching through innovative combinations of  knowledge, improve students’ immersion in case analysis by creating teaching  scenarios, and broaden and enrich students’ thinking by providing interdisciplinary  and cross-cultural perspectives. However, some negative issues have also emerged in  classroom teaching, such as students’ over-reliance on machines, resulting in  weakened independent judgment abilities. Additionally, the systematic avoidance of  value judgments or the output of discriminatory views can reduce the objectivity and  fairness of students’ value judgments. Students may also be influenced by false or  erroneous information output by generative artificial intelligence. Due to limitations  in teaching methods, teaching philosophies, teaching models, technological  development, and sample data, the discussion in this paper on the prospects of legal  education in the era of generative artificial intelligence inevitably has certain  limitations. For example, in terms of data representativeness, this paper has some  deficiencies. Although small-sample exploration of cases and a limited number of  students in class can avoid excessive review processes that could affect curriculum  reform experiments and enhance the flexibility of classroom experiments, the  insufficient number of cases and students inevitably affects the diversity of analytical  perspectives in this paper, as well as the accuracy and representativeness of related  qualitative research. Therefore, based on this curriculum reform experiment, we will gradually expand the use of generative artificial intelligence in legal education  classrooms to further improve and optimize relevant curriculum reform suggestions.  Additionally, many of the research conclusions in this paper, especially those related  to the practical difficulties of applying generative artificial intelligence to legal case  analysis courses, are mostly based on classroom questions and student performance.  However, this paper lacks in-depth and targeted examination and analysis of real  operational data regarding specific issues such as biases and discrimination in  generative artificial intelligence systems. This may affect the precision of the  conclusions drawn in this paper. Therefore, we will continue to pay attention to this  issue and explore the application of generative artificial intelligence systems in more  areas of legal education, providing more feasible, referential, and forward-looking  suggestions for the comprehensive reform of legal education.
