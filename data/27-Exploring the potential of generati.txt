1. Introduction
The emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly generative artificial intelligence (hereafter GenAI) systems like ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer), has significantly transformed human-computer interaction and educational practices (Bewersdorff et al., 2023). These advanced models, fueled by sophisticated machine learning algorithms, exhibit remarkable fluency and coherence in understanding, generating, and manipulating human language (Essel et al., 2024; Jeon & Lee, 2023). GenAI, a class of artificial intelligence systems capable of generating novel and coherent output based on input data and learned patterns, represents a departure from traditional rule-based systems or simple pattern recognition algorithms (Bannister et al., 2023). Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, these models are trained on extensive text data to grasp the underlying structure and semantics of language, enabling them to produce contextually relevant and grammatically correct output (Hsu & Ching, 2023).
The potential of GenAI, especially exemplified by ChatGPT, extends to various facets of language education (see Kohnke et al., 2023). Generative AI models offer extensive opportunities for language practice by generating vast amounts of text in natural language, thereby facilitating reading, writing, and language acquisition (Tseng & Warschauer, 2023). Through interactions with AI-generated content, students can enhance their vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension skills, contributing to overall language proficiency (Lee et al., 2023). Furthermore, GenAI can personalize learning experiences by analyzing learners' interactions and adjusting content and exercises to their proficiency level, learning style, and interests, thereby providing tailored recommendations and feedback in real-time (Carlson et al., 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023). Additionally, GenAI models can function as virtual tutors or language assistants, offering on-demand support, explanations, and guidance to learners. Chatbots powered by AI, such as ChatGPT, simulate natural language interactions, enabling students to engage in conversation, seek clarification, and practice language skills (Ulla et al., 2023).
However, alongside the opportunities presented by GenAI in language education, there exist notable challenges and considerations (see Kohnke et al., 2023). AI-generated content may inadvertently perpetuate biases or stereotypes present in the training data (Alm & Watanabe, 2023), necessitating vigilance in assessing and addressing ethical concerns (Jeon & Lee, 2023), and ensuring that AI-generated materials promote diversity, inclusion, and cultural sensitivity (Kasneci et al., 2023). Moreover, the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated materials may vary (Lee et al., 2023), warranting validation and quality assurance measures (Bonner et al., 2023). Privacy and security concerns regarding student data and interactions also emerge with the adoption of GenAI in education, highlighting the importance of stringent privacy protocols (Kasneci et al., 2023).
While numerous studies have explored the impact of GenAI on language education, there remains a scarcity of research specifically addressing the integration of this technology in resource-constrained environments. Existing literature often focuses on well-resourced settings, leaving a significant gap in understanding how GenAI can be leveraged in contexts facing infrastructural and socio-political challenges, such as Iran. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the potential of GenAI to enhance English language education in Iran, a context marked by unique obstacles that hinder the effective implementation of technology in education, as elucidated in the subsequent section.
2. Literature review
2.1. The affordances and challenges of GenAI in language education
The integration of GenAI in language education has the potential to transform traditional teaching methodologies, providing innovative solutions for content creation, translation, and pedagogical strategies. This literature review critically analyzes the contributions and limitations of various studies on the role of GenAI in language education, focusing on its impact on curriculum design, student engagement, pedagogical innovation, and the challenges faced in technology integration.
The use of GenAI in generating educational content, including lesson plans, quizzes, and interactive exercises, has been widely recognized for its potential to enrich curriculum design. Alm and Watanabe (2023) and McCallum (2024) highlight how AI-generated content can foster student engagement and cultivate critical thinking skills. These studies underscore the capacity of AI to create diverse and adaptive learning materials tailored to individual student needs, thus enhancing the educational experience. Bonner et al. (2023) further emphasize the role of GenAI in fostering intercultural communicative competence, which is crucial in a globalized educational context. However, a critical gap in these studies is the lack of empirical data on the impact of AI-generated content on student outcomes. While the theoretical benefits are well-articulated, there is a need for empirical studies to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of AI-driven curriculum enhancements.
GenAI models with multilingual capabilities offer significant advantages in language translation and localization, aiding students in accessing educational materials in their native languages and improving foreign language acquisition. Li et al. (2023) illustrate how AI can bridge linguistic barriers, making education more inclusive and accessible. This is particularly beneficial in multilingual classrooms, where students can learn in their preferred language without compromising on the quality of education. Despite these advantages, there are challenges related to the accuracy and cultural sensitivity of AI translations. The nuances of language and cultural contexts are often lost in machine translations, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Future research should focus on improving the cultural competency of AI models to better serve diverse student populations.
The application of GenAI in innovative pedagogical methods, such as gamification and storytelling, has been shown to enhance student interest and engagement. Studies (Godwin-Jones, 2023; Jeon & Lee, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023) demonstrate how these approaches can facilitate active participation and knowledge retention. GenAI enables the creation of dynamic and interactive learning environments that cater to various learning styles and preferences. Nonetheless, the implementation of these methods is not without challenges. There is a significant gap in teacher training and preparedness to effectively integrate these technologies into their teaching practices. Moorhouse and Kohnke (2024) argue that without sufficient training and support, teachers may struggle to utilize AI tools to their full potential. Addressing this gap requires comprehensive professional development programs focused on AI literacy and pedagogical innovation.
Despite all affordances, the integration of GenAI in language education faces numerous challenges, including inadequate infrastructure (Demir & Kayaoğlu, 2022) and insufficient technological resources (Dashtestani & Hojatpanah, 2022; Taghizadeh & Ejtehadi, 2023). Additionally, there is difficulty in accessing suitable technology-enhanced materials (Rachmawati et al., 2022) and cultural resistance to new technologies (Tafazoli, 2021). Strategic hurdles related to educational policies and decision-making processes further complicate the integration of AI in education (Dashtestani & Hojatpanah, 2022; Novita et al., 2022). Syllabus and curricular constraints (Gruba & Chau Nguyen, 2019; Meihami, 2021), as well as the complexity of lesson preparation (Zimmer & Matthews, 2022), also pose significant barriers. Insufficient teacher training (Al-khresheh, 2024; Eren, 2023) exacerbates these challenges, highlighting the need for robust support systems and policy frameworks to facilitate the effective use of AI in education.
The integration of GenAI in language education presents both significant opportunities and challenges. While AI has the potential to revolutionize curriculum design, enhance student engagement, and introduce innovative pedagogical methods, there are substantial hurdles to overcome in terms of infrastructure, resources, cultural acceptance, and teacher training. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges, providing empirical evidence on the impacts of AI integration, and developing strategies to support teachers in leveraging AI technologies effectively.
2.2. Technology integration into English language education: the Curious case of Iran
Iran, a nation steeped in historical richness and intellectual heritage, has navigated a complex interplay of policies over the years, with diplomatic decisions and international relations resonating deeply within its educational realm. To grasp the contemporary challenges confronting the Iranian education system within the policy context, an exploration of its historical underpinnings becomes imperative. While Iran boasts a longstanding tradition of scholarship and learning dating back to ancient times, the modern education system began taking shape in the early 20th century with endeavors to formalize schooling and promote literacy. However, following the Islamic Revolution of 1979, significant transformations swept through the education landscape, marked by a pronounced emphasis on Islamic principles, values, and Iranian Revolutionism (Mirhosseini & Miryouness Haghi, 2023).
Among the domains profoundly influenced by these shifts is English language education (Chamani, 2023). In an increasingly globalized world, English proficiency emerges as a coveted skill, bearing implications for economic opportunities, international relations, and cultural exchange (Kramsch, 2014). English language instruction has long been integral to the Iranian education system, evolving over time in response to political dynamics, educational reforms, and shifting societal attitudes towards foreign languages post-Islamic revolution (Hosseini Goodrich, 2020).
However, English language education in Iran grapples with a myriad of challenges, chief among them being the impact of politico-economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western nations (Mehrabi, 2014). These sanctions, often motivated by political tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear program and regional policies, severely impede Iran’s access to educational resources, including English language textbooks, teaching materials, and language learning software (Konuralp & Topping, 2023). Consequently, teachers confront limitations in delivering up-to-date and comprehensive English language instruction, contributing to gaps in students' knowledge and skills. Moreover, Iran’s policies impede opportunities for international collaboration and exchange programs in English language education, restricting partnerships with foreign institutions and hindering cross-cultural engagement (Hwami, 2022).
The ideological underpinnings of the Iranian government further shape the landscape of English language education, influencing curriculum selection, course content, and teaching methodologies. Political considerations dictate the portrayal of Western culture and values in English language materials, reflecting the state’s desired narrative and worldview (Tafazoli & Egan, 2022). This intersection of policy and pedagogy fuels broader debates about language policy and national identity within Iran (Mazlum, 2022), with English language education emerging as a conduit for global engagement while simultaneously eliciting concerns about the potential erosion of Persian language and culture amidst globalization and Western influence (Tafazoli & Egan, 2022).
Despite these formidable challenges, recent years have witnessed a technological revolution in language education, offering a ray of hope amidst adversity. Particularly pertinent in the Iranian context, where resource constraints traditionally hinder access to learning opportunities, technology presents novel avenues for learning, collaboration, and skill development. While numerous studies have explored innovative technological interventions in developing language learners' skills, including computer-mediated collaborative writing (Ebadijalal & Moradkhani, 2023; Khezrlou, 2024), mobile-mediated dynamic assessment (Rassaei, 2023), computerized dynamic assessment (Kargar Behbahani & Karimpour, 2024), technology-mediated vocabulary teaching (Rohollahzadeh Ebadi, 2023), interaction-embedded and interaction-reduced modes of fully online flipped instruction (Shabani & Jabbari, 2023), augmented reality game-supported flipped classrooms (Khazaie & Ebadi, 2023), digital gamification (Foroutan Far & Taghizadeh, 2022), electronic writing portfolio (Fathi & Rahimi, 2022), digital storytelling (Zarei & Navidinia, 2024), computer-mediated corrective feedback (Estaji & Tahamtani, 2023), only one paper explored the affordances of GenAI for such a context. Ghafouri’s (2024) study, focusing on the effects of a ChatGPT-based rapport-building protocol on teacher-student rapport and L2 grit, offers a rare glimpse into the potential of GenAI to enhance language education. However, a dearth of literature specifically examining how language teachers in contexts like Iran can leverage GenAI to navigate their educational challenges persists.
The scarcity of literature investigating the potential of GenAI within contexts such as Iran, marked by a multitude of challenges within the education system, underscores a notable gap in our comprehension of leveraging emerging technologies to meet crucial educational demands. Existing studies predominantly focus on the integration of GenAI in well-resourced settings where infrastructure, access to technology, and educational resources are abundant. However, there is a limited understanding of how GenAI can be effectively utilized in under-resourced and socio-politically constrained environments like Iran. In a nation where economic sanctions, limited resources, and ideological factors significantly mold the educational milieu, English language teachers encounter formidable and unique obstacles in delivering high-quality instruction to their students. Acknowledging this void in scholarly exploration and recognizing the potential of GenAI to alleviate teachers' challenges in Iran, this qualitative study, therefore, addresses the following research question:
How can Iranian English language teachers benefit from GenAI to tackle their educational challenges?
Through this research, the researcher aims to contribute to the broader understanding of GenAI’s potential in diverse educational contexts and offers recommendations for teachers operating in similarly constrained environments. By addressing the specific challenges and opportunities present in the Iranian education system, this study seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of how emerging technologies can be harnessed to improve educational outcomes and bridge existing gaps in resource-limited settings.
3. Methods
3.1. Research design
Creswell (2012) characterizes qualitative research as an educational inquiry reliant on participants' perspectives, employing open-ended questions, gathering textual data, identifying themes, and adopting a subjective stance. Among various qualitative research approaches, the case study method was considered most suitable for this study. According to Yin (2018), a case study is an empirical research method that delves deeply into a specific issue or phenomenon within its real-world context, particularly when the distinction between the phenomenon and its context is blurred. Given the research question’s focus on GenAI integration into language education, the case study approach was deemed appropriate. Fig. 1 illustrates the stages of the study.

3.3. Data collection and analysis
Salmons (2014) proposes that employing multiple methods for data collection can enhance the credibility and reliability of research findings by facilitating result validation. This case study incorporated three data collection instruments: semi-structured interviews, focus group sessions, and reflective essays (refer to Fig. 2). Potential biases included participant self-selection and the researcher’s role in webinar facilitation, which could influence responses. To mitigate biases, transparency in participant selection, varied data collection methods, and rigorous thematic analysis were employed. Cross-case comparisons and member checking enhanced transferability, while inter-coder agreement ensured the dependability of findings (Bergen & Labonté, 2020; van Berkel et al., 2020). The following sections offer additional insights into these tools.

Fig. 2. Stages of data collection.

3.3.1. Focus group sessions
I gathered data to explore teachers' perceptions of GenAI through voluntary participation in focus group sessions. While no coercion was applied to compel participation, all 23 teachers willingly took part in the focus group discussions (n = 23) following each webinar session. These oral group interviews, lasting approximately 20–30 min, were conducted after the completion of each segment of the webinar. Subsequently, the sessions were transcribed, coded, and analyzed. Each focus group session involved the presentation of approximately five questions informed by the literature that were modified by the researcher to fall within the context of the study, all directly related to the content covered during the sessions. Teachers had the opportunity to select the questions they wished to respond to, with subsequent feedback provided by other focus group members. Below you can find some of the questions:
•
What are the most challenges you encounter as English language teachers in Iran’s educational context?
•
How do these challenges impact your ability to effectively teach English to your students?
•
Have you encountered any specific difficulties in teaching English that you believe are unique to the Iranian educational system or cultural context?
•
In what ways do you think technology, particularly AI, could address or alleviate some of these challenges?
•
What resources or support do you currently lack in your efforts to overcome these educational challenges?
•
Are there any concerns or reservations you have about incorporating AI technologies into your teaching practices?
3.3.2. Semi-structured interviews
The use of semi-structured interviews involves a combination of predetermined core questions and spontaneous inquiries that emerge during the conversation. This method offers a degree of structure while allowing flexibility for probing and eliciting additional information. Widely utilized in qualitative research, semi-structured interviews enable interviewers to pose follow-up questions based on participants' responses, fostering deeper exploration of the topic.
For this study, semi-structured interviews were selected as the most suitable data collection method. Core questions were supplemented with sub-questions and probes to ensure comprehensive coverage of the research objectives. Following the conclusion of the webinar, participants engaged in individual semi-structured interviews (n = 10). Conducting one-on-one interviews allowed the researcher to delve deeply into each participant’s perspectives, experiences, and suggestions without external influences such as peer pressure (Orvik et al., 2013). This approach enables the collection of nuanced insights into participants' learning experiences, encountered challenges, and identified areas requiring additional support or resources.
Each interview session lasted approximately 45–60 min and was recorded for transcription purposes. Given that both the interviewer (the researcher) and the participants share Persian (or Farsi) as their native language, all ten interviews were conducted in Persian to ensure clarity of communication. Probes such as “Could you elaborate on your response?” or “Tell me more … ” were utilized to encourage participants to provide detailed responses (Creswell, 2012, p. 221). Some of the questions were:
•
Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you mentioned earlier regarding English language teaching in Iran?
•
Can you provide examples of situations where these challenges have posed significant obstacles in your career?
•
In what ways do you envision AI technologies could assist you in overcoming these challenges?
•
Tell me if there any particular AI-driven solutions or tools you’ve come across in the webinar that you believe could be beneficial in your teaching context?
•
What support or resources do you feel you would need to effectively integrate AI into your teaching practice? How?
3.3.3. Reflective essays
The researcher also requested participants to write reflective essays two weeks after the webinar. This delay allowed participants to contemplate the topic of GenAI further and apply their insights within their teaching contexts. Although the essays provided guiding questions, participants had the freedom to respond to the prompts as extensively or succinctly as they wished.
Ten participants (n = 10) emailed their reflected essays to the researcher. The researcher chose to utilize a comprehensive set of prompts for the reflective essays, encompassing all aspects of the course material rather than solely focusing on specific AI content. Participants were encouraged to share their experiences with ChatGPT utilized during the webinar. Specific questions pertaining to GenAI included:
•
Describe any key insights or new perspectives you gained regarding the role of GenAI in addressing educational challenges for Iranian English language teachers.
•
Reflect on any specific strategies, tools, or approaches discussed during the workshop that you found particularly intriguing or relevant to your teaching context.
•
Consider the challenges discussed during the workshop. How do you envision incorporating AI technologies to overcome these challenges in your own teaching practice?
•
Discuss any concerns or reservations you may have regarding the integration of GenAI into English language teaching, and how you plan to address or mitigate them.
•
How do you anticipate the knowledge and skills gained from this workshop will impact your teaching approach moving forward?
•
Reflect on any personal growth or professional development you experienced as a result of participating in this workshop.
These prompts aimed to elicit participants' reflections on their experiences with GenAI and how they plan to integrate it into their teaching practice to address challenges.
Thematic analysis, following Braun and Clarke’s (2006) framework, was utilized to analyze data collected from three sources (i.e., focus group sessions, semi-structured interviews, and reflective essays). Specifically, inductive thematic analysis was employed, involving deriving meaning and identifying patterns from raw data without preconceived notions. This method ensures an objective analysis without anticipation of results, prioritizing participants' perspectives over the researcher’s (Braun & Clarke, 2006).
NVivo 12 software facilitated thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2006) phases. Data thematization involved multiple recursive phases, with the researcher rereading data inputted into NVivo 12 during the initial phase. The second phase entailed organizing data from initial concepts and uncovering implicit extracts inferred from relevant literature. In the third phase, initial codes were grouped into potential themes using software to create potential parent codes and themes. Discussion with experts ensured accurate representation of participants' intentions. Two research assistants identified common themes and created example lists, evaluating frequency both quantitatively and qualitatively. A panel consensus on final themes was reached, followed by modifications, deletions, and combinations based on expert input. A comprehensive thematic map was created using NVivo 12 in the fourth phase. Consistency across all data sets was ensured by checking obtained themes, with renaming based on interesting words or phrases in teachers' data. In the sixth phase, vivid examples of extracts were selected for inclusion in the Findings section.
The researcher focused on three elements of rigor to ensure the rigor of the findings: credibility, transferability, and dependability (Ary et al., 2014). To enhance credibility, the peer debriefing technique was employed. Two research assistants specializing in applied linguistics reviewed segments of the data to verify the consistency of identified themes. Additionally, member checking was conducted to validate themes with all participants, strengthening the thematization process. For addressing transferability, cross-case comparison was employed. Participants with diverse educational backgrounds and teaching experiences from different regions of Iran were included to enhance the generalizability of the findings. To ensure dependability, inter-coder agreement was evaluated. Another coder assisted in coding 18% of the data, resulting in an 87% inter-coder agreement.
4. Findings
The data analysis identified five main themes from the focus groups, interviews, and reflective essays, illustrating how GenAI, such as ChatGPT, can assist English language teachers in addressing their educational challenges. These themes include: 1. Accessible learning materials, 2. Personalized learning experiences, 3. Addressing ideological influences, 4. Overcoming technological barriers, and 5. Combating isolation from global trends.
It is important to note that while participants discussed various challenges encountered during their preparation, this study did not focus on these challenges, and therefore they were not included in the findings. Additionally, findings related to teachers' professional development have been reported in another study conducted by the researcher and a colleague, due to the purpose of the current study.
4.1. Accessible learning materials
Access to diverse and relevant learning materials is crucial for effective English language instruction in Iran. Participants highlighted the scarcity of up-to-date resources and the challenges of obtaining materials that cater to the specific needs of their students. One participant expressed,

4.3. Addressing ideological influences
English language education in Iran can be influenced by ideological biases, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and content. Participants acknowledged the importance of fostering critical thinking and open-mindedness among their students by exposing them to a variety of viewpoints. A teacher stated, “There’s often a tendency to promote certain ideological narratives in English language education. However, as teachers, it’s crucial for us to encourage critical thinking and expose our students to diverse perspectives” (Interview).
GenAI was seen as a neutral tool that could help mitigate ideological influences by offering access to a wide range of materials from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Teachers reflected,
It’s important for us to be aware of any ideological biases in our curriculum. GenAI has been a valuable resource in addressing this issue. Rather than relying solely on textbooks which may contain biased content, we can use AI-generated materials to introduce diverse perspectives and critical thinking exercises into our lessons. (Focus group session)
Exploring diverse viewpoints can be a challenging task, but thanks to technology, we have new avenues to explore. Personally, I’ve discovered that incorporating ChatGPT’s student discussion chat has been highly beneficial. By facilitating online dialogues on sensitive subjects, students are able to encounter a wide spectrum of opinions and perspectives. This approach fosters critical thinking and enables them to form their own unique outlooks. It’s a subtle yet effective technique that helps to challenge ideological biases while promoting intellectual liberty in our educational endeavors. (Reflective essay)
4.4. Overcoming technological barriers
English language teachers in Iran encounter obstacles related to the availability of up-to-date technologies and their proficiency in using digital tools effectively. Many teachers have limited access to modern technologies due to financial constraints and infrastructure limitations. Additionally, a significant portion of teachers may lack the necessary digital literacy skills to leverage technology effectively in their teaching practice. This lack of access and digital literacy poses challenges for integrating educational technologies into English language instruction and inhibits teachers' ability to keep pace with advancements in the field. A teacher noted, “I’ve always felt overwhelmed by the prospect of integrating technology into my classroom. Many of the tools available require expensive hardware or technical expertise that I simply don’t have” (Interview).
GenAI offers a solution to the challenge of technological barriers by providing a user-friendly platform that does not require high-tech infrastructure or advanced digital literacy skills. Unlike some educational technologies that demand extensive technical expertise or specialized hardware, GenAI can be accessed through standard internet browsers on a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. Moreover, GenAI’s intuitive interface and guided tutorials make it accessible to teachers with varying levels of digital literacy, empowering them to integrate AI-powered tools into their teaching practice with confidence.
