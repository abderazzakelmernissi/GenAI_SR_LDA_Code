Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various aspects of our daily lives. AI has the potential to
change many fields ranging from healthcare and transportation to finance and education. The use of AI
technology can bring about significant benefits and advancements. AI also raises concerns and challenges
to current organizations and applications. Several previous studies discussed the ethical considerations of
using AI generative tools (e.g., ChatGPT) in educational settings. University professors and educators are
currently discussing how they can use AI tools to facilitate student learning and engagement in a responsible
way. Several studies involving AI models have been emphasized on the importance of critically evaluating
the information provided by ChatGPT (Baidoo-Anu & Owusu, 2023).
The potential risks of over-reliance on AI models, such as the risk of perpetuating stereotypes or
disinformation are increasing (Ore & Sposato, 2022). Several studies have focused on the importance of
teaching students how to evaluate information from AI models critically (Ahmed et al., 2022). The majority
of educators are not recommending the usage of ChatGPT to replace traditional teaching methods but rather
should be another tool to help students learn the knowledge that is being shared in the lecture (Baidoo-Anu
& Owusu, 2023). A responsible use of AI generative tools (e.g., ChatGPT) in education emphasizes the importance of teaching students how to critically evaluate the information provided by these tools (Kasneci
et al., 2023).
There are several applications of AI tools for different groups of college students, educators, and
professionals. For college students, ChatGPT can be utilized for various tasks, such as research and writing
assignments, paraphrasing, and summarizing texts, and generating creative writing prompts (Baidoo-Anu
& Owusu, 2023). Similarly, educators can employ AI tools to create interactive quizzes, lesson plans, and
educational materials. Professionals can also benefit from AI tools, as it can assist with tasks such as report
writing, presentation creation, and summarization of large amounts of data. Furthermore, AI tools can be
utilized for customer service and support purposes by generating automated responses to frequently asked
questions (Mhlanga, 2023).
This study assessed the faculties, researchers, and employees in Higher Education on their current usage of
AI tools by categories, AI tools forms, and pricing models. In addition, this study measured an individual's
readiness to embrace new technologies using a multiple-item scale developed by Parasuraman called the
Technology Readiness Index (TRI). The TRI assesses four dimensions of technology readiness: optimism,
innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity.
Literature Review
AI tools have become an increasingly important part of our digital lives. They are designed to automate
tasks, optimize processes, and enhance creativity. The use of AI tools in education is expanding in both
applications and expanding the educational uses for students. Examples of generative AI use cases in
education include generating questions for students differentiated for their current level of understanding
and achievement; generating personalized learning plans for students based on their performance and their
challenges/opportunities in learning; and creating engaging and interactive learning activities such as
simulations of experiential learning or games to help students understand more complex concepts. It is clear
that the use of AI tools has far outweighed the challenges, prompting further research such as this (Selwyn,
2022).

Research Methodology
Research Question
The main goal of the study was to gather the initial perception of faculties, researchers, and employees in
Higher Education on the use of intrusive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence applications in their
educational activities.
Questionnaire Development
For this study, to better understand how individuals perceive and use AI, a survey instrument was created
that asked participants about their experience and opinion on AI technology tools. The questionnaire
contained three sections, demographics, AI-tools use section and Technology Readiness sections. The first
section gathered information on age, gender, area of expertise, and area of research. The second section
contained questions extrapolated from Owens (2023) studies on use and perceptions toward artificial
intelligence. The third section contained questions from the TRI instrument (Parasuraman, 2000;
Parasuraman & Colby, 2015).
TRI is a multiple-item scale developed by Parasuraman in 2000 that measures an individual's or
organization's readiness to embrace new technologies. The TRI assesses four dimensions of technology
readiness: optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity. The scale was developed to provide insight
into how individuals and organizations perceive and approach new technologies, and to identify potential
barriers to technology adoption and usage. The TRI has become a widely used tool for researchers and
practitioners in a variety of industries. The TRI can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence
technology adoption and usage by measuring an individual's or organization's levels of optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity. The scale has been used to assess technology readiness in
healthcare, education, marketing, finance, and other industries.
The importance of technology readiness has become increasingly apparent as new technologies emerge and
become integrated into our daily lives. Understanding an individual's or organization's technology readiness
can help identify potential barriers to technology adoption and inform strategies for promoting technology
usage. The TRI is a valuable tool for anyone interested in understanding and promoting technology adoption
and usage (Parasuraman & Colby, 2015).
A full 16 item scale was used for this study that focused primarily on TRI 2.0 (Parasuraman & Colby,
2015). This scale provided measures on four TRI dimensions: optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and
insecurity. These questions are also copyrighted by A. Parasuraman and Rockbridge Associates, Inc., 2014.
This scale may be duplicated only with written permission from the authors. Written permission was
obtained for the use of the TRI instrument in March 2023.
Questionnaire Distribution and Data Collection Methodology
The questionnaire was distributed to people working in the Higher Education field from January 2023 to
May 2023 through email, Slack channels, and LinkedIn. The survey was exported into a Qualtrics software
tool and then distributed online to a random set of faculties, researchers, IT professionals, and employees
in Higher Education. The data was exported in an excel spreadsheet and analyzed. The data from the TRI
section was sent for additional analysis to Rockbridge Associates.
Results
The questionnaire was taken by 46 people (n=46). For the third part of the survey, 3 answers were removed
due to partial completion and 43 answers were used (n=43) for the examination of the TRI index. The
demographics of this study is displayed in Figure 1. The participants were predominantly male (67%) as
compared to female (33%). The majority of participants fell within the age range of 30-49 years old, with
28% in 30-39 and 20% in 40-49 age groups. Participants in the 20-29 age range accounted for 20% of the
total, followed by 17% in the 50-59, 11% in the 60 and over, and 4% under 20 years old.
Figure 1. Demographics of the participants by Gender and Age As shown on Figure 2, 41% of the participants were IT professionals, 22% worked in faculty positions,
11% in higher education, 11% were researchers, and 15% held various other positions. As for educational
qualifications, 46% of the participants held a Master's degree, 28% had a Doctoral degree, 20% held a
Bachelor's degree, and 6% held other degrees.
Figure 2. Demographics of the participants by Educational Level and Position
As displayed in Figure 3, the majority of participants reported using AI tools for chat, research, and
entertainment, with text-to-speech and speech-to-text as secondary uses. Other significant applications
included gaming, increasing productivity, and generating code. Notably, a sizable portion of participants
reported using AI tools for creative purposes such as image and video creation, music composition, and
inspiration. In contrast, AI tools were less frequently used for financial advising, avatar creation, selfimprovement, and copywriting. Only minimal usage was reported for podcasting, translation, video editing,
generative art, motion capture, prompt guides, text-to-video, and voice modulation. A few participants
reported exploring AI detection, aggregations, and generative video, and none for marketing.
Figure 3. Area of use of AI tools 
As shown on Figure 4, the majority of participants expressed that their usage of AI tools is driven by
curiosity (31%) and occasional need (30%). A smaller portion mentioned using AI tools once a week (17%)
or every day (9%). Interestingly, only 13% of participants reported not using any generative AI tools.
Additionally, a significant majority of the participants (76%) preferred free tools and freemium (4%),
followed by open-source options (9%), and applications on GitHub (7%). Only 4% reported a preference
for paid options.
Figure 4. Frequency of use and Preferred AI tools
Figure 5 displays the primary use of AI tools among individuals in Higher Education. The majority of
respondents used AI tools for creative activities unrelated to their research, as well as for brainstorming
ideas, writing code, and preparing presentations. A smaller number of respondents used AI tools for creating
graphics, developing scientific search engines, writing coursework or exams, conducting literature reviews,
and researching manuscripts. Interestingly, none of the respondents reported using AI tools for writing grant
applications.

Additional comments
An open-ended question was included in the survey to gather additional comments about AI usage. One
participant mentioned that AI tools were helpful in reducing the workload of data analytics developers,
allowing them to focus on fixing errors in SQL code. Other concerns were expressed, such as the potential
for biased or negative use of AI and the possibility of creating knowledge gaps between those who know
how to use it and those who do not know how to use the AI tool. Some participants viewed AI tools as a
double-edged sword that can have both positive and negative impacts, depending on how it is used and
regulated in the future.
Technology Readiness Index
The Technology Readiness Segmentation is an important tool for marketers and researchers. Businesses
can tailor their marketing efforts to specific groups, while researchers can gain a deeper understanding of
their subjects by understanding the different segments of technology users. Rockbridge and Parasuraman's
recent research introduced a comprehensive segmentation typology that encompasses various belief
combinations (Parasuraman, 2000; Parasuraman & Colby, 2015). This segmentation framework allows for
a tailored marketing approach when promoting cutting-edge products or services. Additionally, it provides
researchers with a powerful tool for effectively describing their research subjects.
The segmentation consists of distinct segments, namely the technology-driven "Explorers," the highly
engaged "Pioneers," the indifferent "Skeptics," the cautious "Hesitators," and the technology-resistant
"Avoiders." These segments offer valuable insights into different attitudes and behaviors towards
technology adoption. In this study, a survey comprising 16 questions of the TRI was used to segment
participants into those five distinct groups.
The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 1. The general profile of mature consumer segments
presented in Table 1 (first row), compared to the norm value provided by Rockbridge and Parasuraman
(second row), along with further analysis and profile of these segments in terms of Technology Readiness
(TR) dimensions. By examining the mean scores on each dimension for each segment, this study identified
distinct patterns that described the unique beliefs held by each segment. This provided a deeper
understanding of how these segments differ from one another in terms of their technology readiness.
Table 1. Differing beliefs of technology adoption segments
The results of the study showed that Explorers (42%) and Pioneers (21%) were the most highly engaged
with technology, with strong beliefs in its benefits and a willingness to adopt new technologies quickly.
Skeptics (23%), on the other hand, had high optimism and innovativeness but more moderate beliefs and
were less likely to be early adopters. Hesitators (12%) were more cautious in their approach to technology,
with a tendency to wait for others to adopt new technologies before doing so themselves. Avoiders (2%)
were the least engaged with technology, with strong beliefs in its risks and a preference for traditional
methods.
Findings
TRI is multifaceted. There are two dimensions for Drivers/motivators (Optimism and Innovativeness) and
two for Inhibitors (Discomfort and Insecurity). Optimism refers to a general belief that technology and
innovation bring forth positive benefits. Innovativeness, on the other hand, represents an innate inclination
to explore, learn, and discuss technology. However, there are also inhibitors that can hinder technology
adoption. Discomfort arises from a perceived lack of control over technology, while insecurity stems from
the belief that technology can have negative consequences for users and society.
The data analysis showed that the Explorers (42%) were above the norm value provided by the Rockbridge
and Parasuraman (24.2%). The explorers have high optimism and innovativeness and low discomfort and
insecurity. The Skeptics (23%) were also lower than the norm value provided by Rockbridge and
Parasuraman (29.3%) with high optimism and innovativeness and low discomfort and moderate insecurity.
The Pioneers (21%) were slightly above the norm value (18.3%) with high optimism and innovativeness
and low discomfort and moderate insecurity. This study indicated that the Hesitators (12%) were lower than
the norm with high optimism and innovativeness, low discomfort, and high insecurity. The Avoiders (2%)
were lower than the suggested normal values (13.4%) with low optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and
insecurity. As expected, the results indicated that individuals from Higher Education were more eager to
engage in researching and testing new technology. The medium level of insecurity shown in Table 1
suggested that exploration into this area should be addressed carefully.
Discussion
The study showed an enthusiasm about the use of AI tools among people from Higher Education. However,
educators that are incorporating AI generative tools (e.g., ChatGPT) into their teaching practice should
undertake a responsible approach. Yang (2023) emphasized on the importance of responsible usage,
ensuring that students are aware of the AI's limitations while understanding that it is a tool, and not a
replacement for human interaction. AI tools could be used as a supplement to classroom discussions,
allowing students to engage in conversations and explore different perspectives. The educators should
maintain an active role in guiding and moderating the AI-generated responses, promoting critical thinking
and analysis among students. Additionally, an ethical consideration surrounding the use of AI in education
should examine the significance of fostering an inclusive and collaborative learning environment.
Several practical tips were suggested by Yang (2023) when regarding the implementation of generative
AI tools such as ChatGPT in the classroom that can increase productivity:
● Familiarizing with the use of ChatGPT by dedicating time to learn and practice entering prompts
effectively.
● Enhancing assessment methods by incorporating oral presentations, which not only promote
originality but also mitigate the risk of plagiarism.

● Remaining mindful of the potential impact of ChatGPT on exacerbating inequality and actively
engage in decolonizing a curriculum to foster inclusivity.
● Establishing clear goals for implementing ChatGPT, ensuring a solid understanding of the
outcomes one seek to achieve.
● Experimenting with different prompts, testing them with ChatGPT, and iteratively refining them
based on the results until attaining the desired outcomes.
● Collaborating with fellow educators and students to co-edit and improve prompts, leveraging
diverse perspectives for comprehensive refinement.
Limitations
This study had certain limitations that should be acknowledged. A limitation existed in regard to the data
collection being limited to individuals in the Higher Education sector, potentially resulting in different
outcomes if data had been collected from diverse occupations. Another limitation was that this study had a
relatively small sample size, albeit randomized, and anonymized. Conducting a future study with a larger
and more diverse group could provide further insights and validate the consistency of the findings.
Conclusion
This study revealed that the majority of participants' primary use of AI tools was out of curiosity and
occasional necessity and showing a preference for free options over paid alternatives. These tools were
commonly employed for creative pursuits independent of research, as well as for activities such as idea
generation, coding, and presentation preparation. Notably, individuals in Higher Education exhibited
significant enthusiasm towards harnessing the potential of AI generative tools, with indications of readiness
to integrate them into their classrooms. However, the study emphasized the crucial need for responsible and
meticulous implementation of such tools, highlighting the importance of careful consideration and
conscientious approaches.
