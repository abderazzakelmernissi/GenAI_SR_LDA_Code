Exploring the impact of generative AI technologies on education: Academic  expert perspectives, trends, and implications for sustainable development  goals

Abstract: This study provides empirical data on the impact of generative AI in education, with special emphasis on sustainable development goals (SDGs). By conducting a thorough analysis of the relationship between generative AI technologies and educational outcomes, this research fills a critical gap in the literature. The insights offered are valuable for policymakers seeking to leverage new educational technologies to support sustainable development. Using SmartPLS4, five hypotheses derived from the research questions were tested based on data collected from an E-Questionnaire distributed to academic faculty members and education managers. Of the 311 valid responses, the measurement model assessment confirmed the validity and reliability of the data, while the structural model assessment validated the hypotheses. The study’s findings reveal that New Approaches to Learning Outcome Assessment (NALOA) significantly contribute to achieving SDGs, with a path coefficient of 0.477 (p < 0.001). Similarly, the Use of Generative AI Technologies (UGAIT) has a notable positive impact on SDGs, with a value of 0.221 (p < 0.001). A Paradigm Shift in Education and Educational Process Organization (PSEPQ) also demonstrates a significant, though smaller, effect on SDGs with a coefficient of 0.142 (p = 0.008). However, the Opportunities and Risks of Generative AI in Education (ORGIE) study did not find statistically significant evidence of an impact on SDGs (p = 0.390). These findings highlight the potential opportunities and challenges of using generative AI technologies in education and underscore their key role in advancing sustainable development goals. The study also offers a strategic roadmap for educational institutions, particularly in Oman to harness AI technology in support of sustainable development objectives.

1. Introduction  Currently, we are observing significant changes in the use of artificial intelligence  (AI), propelled by a new generation of robust generative AI models that can produce  wholly original datasets (Anderson, 2020; Shannaq, 2024a). Projections indicate that  these breakthroughs will have a substantial impact on the progress of society in the  next five to 10 years. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing fast development and  becoming a readily available tool in many fields and for a diverse range of users  (Rashid Al-Shamsi and Shannaq, 2024; Yusuf et al., 2024). From this standpoint, it is  highly important to analyze the possible influence of generative AI advancement on  education. Will this result in a revolutionary change in the fundamental principles of  CITATION  Alshamsi I, Sadriwala KF, Alazzawi FJI, Shannaq B. (2024).

In  what manner will it be relevant to the particular obstacles encountered within the  educational domain? The assessment of the potential advantages and drawbacks of  including generative AI into higher education is of utmost importance, and it is  imperative to expedite its integration into educational environments (Alasadi and Baiz,  2023; Al-Shamsi et al., 2024; Kamalov et al., 2023).  The worldwide community views the implementation of Generative AI, a digital  technology that may produce visual, textual, or animated information, as a crucial  element of educational digitalization. This technology has the potential to bring about  significant changes in educational practices (Olney et al., 2024; Shannaq et al., 2019).  In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  (Lehtonen, 2020) highlighted important principles and suggestions, such as:  • Enhancing knowledge generation and skill development through innovative  educational technologies facilitated by generative AI.  • Guaranteeing technology accessibility for educators and students.  • Facilitating the education of persons with disabilities, particularly those with  dyslexia or in need of ongoing guidance and mentoring, using generative AI.  1.1. Problem statement  The incorporation of generative artificial intelligence products into educational  institutions offers both prospects and obstacles. While artificial intelligence (AI) has  the potential to transform personalized learning and broaden access to educational  opportunities, there are worries about data privacy, fair access, and the potential  devaluation of critical thinking abilities resulting from over dependence on automated  technologies. These problems have the potential to impact the caliber of educational  achievements and hinder the advancement towards the Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations, namely those pertaining to education  (SDG 4), innovation (SDG 9), and the decrease of inequality (SDG 10). For  policymakers and educators to mitigate dangers and leverage the advantages of AI for  sustainable development, it is crucial to have a comprehensive knowledge of how  these technologies affect educational results.  1.2. Contribution to the research  This work contributes to the current body of knowledge by providing a thorough  examination of the viewpoints of professional experts on the use of generative AI in  the field of education, with specific emphasis on Oman. This paper analyses the  responses of university administrators and stakeholders, offering valuable insights into  the implementation and regulation of new technologies in educational settings.  Furthermore, hypotheses are formulated and examined to give empirical proof of the  efficacy of AI technology in attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  1.2.1. An argument in support of using Oman as a case study  For a number of important reasons, Oman was selected to serve as the case study.  To begin, Oman is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is a  region that is actively participating in the pursuit of technology improvements and  digital transformation across a variety of sectors, including education. As part of its Vision 2040, which is in line with the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),  the nation has made major investments in the incorporation of artificial intelligence  (AI) and other digital technologies into its educational system. Nevertheless, in spite  of these efforts, difficulties like gaps in digital infrastructure, uneven access to  technology, and the requirement for educators to acquire additional skills, continue to  be prominent. As a result, Oman is an ideal candidate for investigating the influence  that artificial intelligence technologies have on education. As an additional point of  interest, Oman is an example of a developing nation that successfully combines  traditional educational methodologies with contemporary technology innovation. This  duality offers a one-of-a-kind environment in which to investigate the ways in which  artificial intelligence technologies might either worsen or relieve current educational  disparities, notably those that are associated with Sustainable Development Goal 4  (Quality Education) and Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Disparities).  The purpose of this research is to develop insights that may be applied to other  nations that are in comparable phases of digital transformation. According to the  World Economic Forum, Oman has been aggressively incorporating artificial  intelligence (AI) in its educational system. However, the country is facing hurdles in  establishing equitable access to technology throughout urban and rural regions. It was  noted in a report that was published in 2022 by the Ministry of Education in Oman  that only 68% of students who live in rural areas have access to dependable digital  infrastructure. This highlights a significant digital divide that may influence the  successful implementation of artificial intelligence in education.  The significance of Oman as a case study is highlighted by these figures, which  also lend credence to the more general assertion that incorporating AI into educational  settings continues to be a difficulty, particularly in developing nations.  1.3. Research gap  Although the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education is  becoming more widely discussed, less attention has been paid to the implications of  this technology specifically in Arab contexts, most notably in Oman. In order to close  this gap, this study examines how these technologies are used and viewed in Omani  educational institutions and evaluates their effect on the nation’s advancement toward  the SDGs. Additionally, the study shows that in order to maximize the advantages and  minimize the hazards of generative AI in education, localized techniques are required.  1.4. Significance of the work  With an emphasis on Oman, this research offers crucial insights on the uptake  and effects of generative AI technologies in the Arab educational context.  Policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders in the area will benefit from the  results, which will provide guidance on how to effectively integrate these technologies  to improve learning outcomes and help to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.  The research intends to direct the creation of efficient techniques that are in line with  the educational and cultural landscape of Oman and comparable contexts by  emphasizing both the benefits and constraints of Generative AI in education.  Focusing on trends in Generative AI Technologies and sustainable development goals, the research formulates research questions mapped to independent variables  including Use of Generative AI Technologies (UGAIT), Development of Text  Recognition Technologies for AI-generated Texts (DTRTAIT), New approaches to  learning outcome assessment (NALOA), Paradigm Shifts in Education and  Educational Process Organization (PSEPQ), and Opportunities and Risks of  Generative AI in Education (ORGIE), with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  as the dependent variable.  A study’s objectives, hypotheses, and research questions are developed  methodically, taking into account the study’s particular setting, the literature review,  and the research topic. The research questions, which attempt to address specific  aspects like the effects of these technologies on educational outcomes, the opinions of  academic experts, and the actions taken by educational institutions, are based on the  research problem, which in this case is the impact of generative artificial intelligence  (AI) technologies on education within the framework of SDGs. The gaps in the  literature, particularly with regard to the effects of generative AI in the Arab world,  notably in Oman, also influence these topics. These questions directly relate with the  research objectives, each of which describes the goals of the study (e.g., assessing the  efficacy of generative AI in improving student learning outcomes). These goals are set  up to be quantifiable and reachable, guaranteeing that they will provide useful  information to address the research issue. The theoretical framework and prior study  findings feed hypotheses, which are testable predictions drawn from the goals. They  show how factors, such as the use of generative AI technology and the advancement  of the SDGs, are projected to relate to one another. The unique cultural and educational  background of Oman is taken into account while creating these components, as well  as the concerns of important stakeholders including students, legislators, and  instructors.  This strategy guarantees that the study covers pertinent topics and offers  insightful information. To assess the impact of generative AI technologies on  educational outcomes and test the hypothesis that these technologies have a positive  effect on SDG achievement in Oman, a research question might, for instance, examine  how these technologies affect SDG achievement in the Omani educational context.  Through the methodical development of these elements, the research guarantees that  it tackles the important problems and offers valuable perspectives to the domain.  1.4.1.

This study employs a structured methodology to investigate how Generative AI  in Education applications used in teaching and learning, can positively shape the  growing integration of generative AI in education, exemplified by platforms like  ChatGPT-4o, and has sparked debates on its implications for the educational landscape.  Diverse viewpoints range from advocating for restricted access until fundamental  changes in education occur. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of academic  expert opinions on the matter, alongside responses from university professors and  stakeholders, aiming to provide a holistic view of the discourse.  2. Literature review  A significant research assesses the contribution of ChatGPT in management  education, specifically examining its efficacy in fostering active learning, critical  thinking, and creativity. The paper analyses the influence of artificial intelligence on  student involvement and its incorporation into conventional education, while  considering ethical issues such as the genuineness of knowledge and prejudice. Results  indicate that ChatGPT improves teaching approaches but emphasize the need of  meticulous deployment, infrastructure, and ethical reflections. The study provides  vital knowledge for educators and institutions and adds novel viewpoints to the  discussion on artificial intelligence in education (Leelavathi and Surendhranatha, 2024;  Ratten and Jones, 2023).  A study that investigates how teachers, students, and administrative staff in Oman  assess the role that ChatGPT plays in education have analyzed the influence that  artificial intelligence has on education in Arab nations. It does this by evaluating the  influence that artificial intelligence has on the process of refining material, creating  emails, and explaining complicated activities, particularly for those who do not use  English as their first language. Despite the fact that ChatGPT is highly appreciated for  its ability to assist in academic assignments, there are issues around excessive  dependency and academic integrity. The findings provide direction for educational  policies and research in the future within the framework of Oman’s educational system  (Syahrin and Akmal, 2024).  At the University of A’Sharqiyah, which is located in the Sultanate of Oman, a  recent study was conducted to investigate the role that artificial intelligence (AI) plays in improving the quality of instruction. In this study, qualitative research  methodologies were utilized to conduct interviews with four experienced educators.  Personalized learning, grading automation, and virtual help were some of the uses of  artificial intelligence that were discussed during the interviews. Other topics that were  covered included, how AI may improve education and teaching qualityensuring ethical  and inclusive practices. With a heavy emphasis on ethical usage, openness, and  education on AI ethics, the findings indicated a variety of viewpoints regarding the  benefits of artificial intelligence. One of the most important proposals is to encourage  the use of artificial intelligence in education while also addressing ethical concerns  (Al Matari et al., 2023; Shannaq et al., 2024).  Higher education institutions (HEIs) play a crucial role in bridging this gap  through curriculum updates and infrastructure improvements. Concurrently, global  initiatives like the SDGs underscore the importance of Education for Sustainable  Development (ESD). As digital technologies reshape industries, AI integration in  education, exemplified by ChatGPT, emerges as a transformative force, albeit with  ethical considerations and the need for curriculum alignment. This paper critically  examines AI’s integration, emphasizing ChatGPT, within ESD’s context, offering  insights for navigating educational evolution in a tech-driven era effectively (Shannaq,  2024b). This work explores search engines’ vital role in the digital economy,  facilitating access to information, products, and services. It underscores query  formulation’s significance in efficient information retrieval, particularly for  businesses in today’s data-rich landscape. The study introduces the Interactive Digital  Associative Tool (IDAT) to bolster human memory and conceptual thinking by linking  Google search results with related terms. This fosters insightful connections and better  query formulation, enhancing profitability and productivity. The IDAT’s online  accessibility fosters conceptual innovation in education and business amid digital  transformation, aiming to improve human-computer interaction (HCI). An experiment  with 14 users demonstrated a proficiency increase in query formulation from 51.0%  to 88%, with query time reduced from 113.0 to 61.0, underscoring IDAT’s significant  impact.  In (Wang, 2023) Generative AI, like ChatGPT, is gaining traction for its  transformative potential in various sectors, notably higher education. While some see  it as revolutionary for learning, others raise concerns about its impact on academic  integrity and student capabilities. As ChatGPT-like models become more prevalent,  understanding their effects on higher education and devising mitigation strategies is  crucial. This paper conducts a literature review to assess generative AI’s influence on  higher education, emphasizing both opportunities and challenges. It concludes with  four strategies for HEIs to navigate the use of Generative AI effectively while  addressing associated concerns.  The study (Shannaq, 2024c) presents a structured approach developed from a  case study at the University of Buraimi, Oman, aiming to address challenges in  formative assessment within Omani educational systems. By adapting and  modernizing formative assessment, the model caters to Arabic cultural backgrounds  and enhances classroom participation. Leveraging the Moodle Learning System, the  solution transforms formative assessment into a digital format. Results show a 90%  success rate and a 10% improvement in academic performance, indicating digital formative assessment’s potential in enhancing student learning outcomes amidst  cultural and participation challenges.  According to (Bahroun et al., 2023) in an era of rapid technological progress,  generative artificial intelligence (GAI) emerges as a transformative influence,  reshaping education. This review, following the PRISMA framework, offers a  thorough examination of GAI in education. Synthesizing insights from 207 research  papers, it pinpoints research gaps and future paths. Ethical concerns, interdisciplinary  collaboration, and transparent AI models are emphasized, alongside a bibliometric  analysis highlighting ChatGPT’s prominence and the growing interest in GAI research.  As in (Shannaq et al., 2023) an extensive examination of the telecommunications  industry’s external environment, encompassing both industry-wide and regional  markets for wired and wireless communication services, was conducted. The study  evaluated the potential application of foreign companies’ experience and crisis  management measures from other sectors. Additionally, a thorough analysis of factors  shaping enterprise competitiveness in the market was undertaken, utilizing the  competitiveness polygon method. Competitive positions were assessed based on a  wide array of service criteria, leading to the development of an integrated SWOT  strategy comprising SO, WO, ST, and WT strategies. This strategic analysis aims to  establish a unique position for long-term enterprise sustainability amidst changing  economic conditions, including downturns (Segumpan and McAlaney, 2023).  The years 2020 and 2021 prompted a reassessment of traditional educational  paradigms due to the pandemic’s impact, particularly on universities. Higher  education, crucial for societal progress, faced challenges. Oman’s higher education  leadership aimed to adapt new norms, transitioning from face-to-face teaching. This  study addressed pandemic-induced shortcomings in higher education and proposed  solutions for sustainable university development during those unprecedented times. In  (Al-Shamsi et al., 2023) the author opines that the existing literature often examines  Quality of Service (QoS) evaluation independently, hindering a comprehensive  understanding of service quality management. Analytical techniques aid in decisionmaking to enhance service quality, attracting customers and driving sales and profit  growth in the Telecommunication sector. The study compared service quality between  private and public telecom companies in Oman, focusing on customer satisfaction  through a customized SERVQUAL model with six dimensions. Analysis of 62  responses using statistical tools revealed similar service quality levels between private  and public companies, except for reliability.  As global efforts intensify to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs), Generative AI emerges as a powerful tool to tackle intricate  sustainability challenges Ratten and Jones, (2023) and Yusuf et al. (2024). This form  of AI excels at generating new content like images, music, and text by learning from  extensive datasets, offering creative solutions and fostering innovation for sustainable  development. This article explores how Generative AI can advance SDG 11  (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), focusing on its  potential applications in optimizing energy management and supporting sustainable  urban planning. They examine a case study in Athens, Greece, where Generative AI  is employed to enhance energy efficiency, promote renewable energy adoption, and  inform urban planning strategies, aligning with the city’s vision of a greener, resilient

future. As in (Shakir et al., 2024; Shannaq and Al Shamsi, 2024) the key topics  included leveraging AI for SDG progress, challenges in AI adoption for developing  nations, ethical considerations, implications for information ecosystems, and language  barriers. Conclusions emphasized the importance of improving connectivity and  affordability, establishing ethical frameworks, implementing balanced regulations,  and fostering multi stake holder collaboration for effective AI deployment and  capacity building.  In (Jungwirth and Haluza, 2023; Sadriwala et al., 2024; Shannaq et al., 2024)  recent years have witnessed significant advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI),  prompting recognition of its potential across diverse sectors. However, concerns have  arisen regarding AI’s impact on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The study aimed to assess AI’s contributions and potential influence on sustainable  development, particularly in societal domains. Analysis of GPT-3 responses, a leading  language model, revealed its broad capabilities for contributing to SDGs, underscoring  the need for proper regulations to ensure responsible AI use. Additionally, the study  suggested enhancing GPT-3’s neural language processing skills by avoiding mimicry  of weak human writing styles with more errors in longer texts.  The transformational potential, ethical issues, and effects on educational results  are the main topics of the literature that is currently available on the integration of  generative AI technology in education. Research has looked at the role artificial  intelligence (AI) can play in a number of educational contexts, such as higher  education and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on  the consequences of technological breakthroughs.  By offering a thorough examination of the effects of generative AI technologies  on education within the unique cultural and educational setting of Oman, our research  closes this gap. Our study closes the knowledge gap between localized educational  practices in the Arab world and global AI discourses by concentrating on the opinions  and trends of academic experts. We investigate the ways in which these technologies  impact Oman’s aims for sustainable development, providing specifically regional  insights. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how Generative  AI can be leveraged to achieve educational and sustainable development objectives in  Arab countries by addressing the need for empirical data and analysis regarding the  adoption and effectiveness of AI-driven educational tools in Oman.  3. Materials and methods  The proposed conceptual model in this study is depicted in Figure 1 and  elaborated upon to provide a thorough understanding of each step. In this work we use  the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). More  information about the PLS-SEM is available in (Hair et al., 2024; Hair, Gabriel, et al.,  2019). To assess the efficacy of various factors related to generative AI and  educational technologies influence progress towards achieving SDGs.  The proposed methodology in this work employs a descriptive analytical  approach to assess the present situation, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative  analysis and to investigate the efficacy of generative AI and educational technologies.  The objective of this study aims to investigate the impact of several factors on progress
towards SDGs. Firstly, it seeks to explore the influence of the use of generative AI  technologies (UGAIT) on SDGs. Secondly, it aims to evaluate the impact of the  development of text recognition technologies for AI-generated texts (DTRTAIT) on  SDGs. Thirdly, the study examines the relationship between new approaches to  learning outcome assessment (NALOA) and progress towards SDGs. Furthermore, it  explores the effect of paradigm shifts in education and educational process  organization (PSEPQ) on SDGs. Lastly, the research aims to assess the opportunities  and risks associated with generative AI in education (ORGIE) and their effect on  progress towards SDGs.  Figure 1. Conceptual framework.  The survey can be accessed by visiting (Navigating Generative AI in Education,  2024) and its structure with variables and their indicators as well as the abbreviation  of each variable and indicators for the simple use in the Smart-PLS4 software and a  sample of the survey structure explained in Table 1.

The first section aimed to collect  demographic information about faculty members, including details such as age, years of experience, specialty major, and country of PhD graduation. Section two, through  six questions focused on different aspects called independent variables, included the  Use of Generative AI Technologies (UGAIT), Development of Text Recognition  Technologies for AI-generated Texts (DTRTAIT), New Approaches to Learning  Outcome Assessment (NALOA), Paradigm Shift in Education and Educational  Process Organization (PSEPQ), and Opportunities and Risks of Generative AI in  Education (ORGIE). Sustainable development goals were considered as the dependent  variable (IV_SDG). Each independent variable consisted of five questions or  indicators. Table 1 presents the structure of the survey, illustrating the organization of  these sections.  3.1. Data collection and sampling process  Following a thorough review of pertinent literature and the identification of  research problems, questions, hypotheses, and objectives, a clear understanding of the  required data was obtained. Consequently, a questionnaire was developed, comprising  five independent variables and one dependent variable. Each variable consisted of five  indicators to accurately represent them. To ensure clarity and simplicity for  respondents, all questions underwent expert review to prevent ambiguity or  misunderstanding.  Subsequently, the questionnaire was created and uploaded to Google Drive as an  E-questionnaire (Navigating Generative AI in Education, 2024) to streamline  distribution and data collection processes. Before dissemination, a strict adherence to  the sampling process was followed. The population was defined solely as instructors  working in higher institutions in the Gulf countries, based on their availability via  email or mobile phones. Most participants were affiliated with universities in Oman,  while others were recruited from previous professional relationships and engagements  in webinars and conferences. The E-questionnaire was administered from 1 September  2023 to 22 March 2024.  The sampling frame was established using instructor emails, employing a nonprobability sampling design due to constraints in time and email availability. A sample  size of 789 professors was determined in line with research objectives and population  variability. Within this sampling framework, convenience sampling was utilized,  targeting instructors best positioned to provide relevant information.  On 22 March 2024, 311 responses were received from the initially contacted 789  professors. Based on previous literature, it was concluded that a sample size of 250 or  more would yield comparable results. Therefore, 311 responses were considered  sufficient for subsequent analysis and research progression. References to prior studies  by Hair, L.D.S. Gabriel, et al. (2019) guided the decision-making process regarding  sample size considerations.  3.2. Data cleaning process  After retrieving the data from Google Form in CSV format, we commenced the  data cleaning process using SPSS software. Initially, we scrutinized the minimum and  maximum values within our dataset. Our data utilized a five-point Likert measurement  scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, with the minimum value 
recorded as one (1) and the maximum value as five (5). Since these values were  automatically generated by Google Form, the risk of manual data entry errors was  eliminated.  Subsequently, we addressed any missing data, which were absent due to all  questions in the Google Form being designated as mandatory entries. Moving forward,  we conducted outlier detection to identify any extreme values. However, no outliers  were detected, as all data were auto-calculated by Google Form.  In the fourth step of data cleaning, we examined for any anomalous responses by  calculating the standard deviation. The standard deviation for all variables ranged  between 0.85836 and 2.006025. As per statistical guidelines (Hair, Page, et al., 2019),  (Hair et al., 2021; Hair, Risher, et al., 2019) values falling within plus or minus 2  standard deviations (SD) are considered close to the true value.  4. Data analysis and results  4.1. Reliability and validity  Reliability and validity were evaluated using Cronbach’s Alpha and Composite  Reliability (CR). Initially, any items with factor loadings below 0.700 were removed  from the dataset. The construct of Development of Text Recognition Technologies for  AI-generated Texts (DTRTAIT) was excluded from the analysis due to its lack of  significant relationship with the dependent variable and its inconsistency with the  IV_SDG variable. This decision was made after conducting thorough tests, including  AVE and HTMT, and examining the standard deviation between the two variables.  More than 35 records had a standard deviation of 0.000, while others were less than  0.2, possibly due to similar responses across variables. Consequently, removing the  DTRTAIT construct ensures a more coherent and accurate model, addressing  reliability and precision concerns. All indicators with factor loadings below the  recommended threshold of 0.7 were eliminated, as illustrated in Figure 2 before  removal and Figure 3 after removal.  Figure 2. Constructs and indicators values before removing process.
Figure 3. Constructs and indicators values after removing process.  The reliability and validity of the remaining items, along with their factor  loadings, are presented in Table 2. All alpha values and CRs surpassed the  recommended threshold of 0.700, indicating strong reliability. Convergent validity  was confirmed by Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and CR values, all of which  were equal to or greater than 0.500 and 0.700, respectively. Discriminant validity was  established through cross-loadings, where factor loadings exceeded cross-loadings for  all items, indicating distinctiveness. Additionally, multicollinearity was assessed with  Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values below 5 for each indicator, suggesting the  absence of multicollinearity issues. Finally, Table 3 displayed the cross-factor  loadings of all items, showing that factor loadings consistently outweighed their crossloadings, further affirming discriminant validity.  Table 2.

Discussion about DTRTAIT exclusion  The choice to omit the Development of Text Recognition Technologies for AIgenerated Texts (DTRTAIT) variable was decided based on numerous factors:  4.1.2. Focus on educational impact  The major goal of our research is to investigate the function of Generative AI  technologies in enhancing educational results and supporting the Sustainable  Development Goals. While DTRTAIT is important in the larger context of AI, it is  more concerned with technological breakthroughs and the detection of AI-generated  information than with affecting teaching, learning, or knowledge transfer processes.  As a result, integrating DTRTAIT in the current study would have shifted the focus  away from the educational components we wanted to investigate.  4.1.3. Relevance to professors’ opinions  Our research is centered on the opinions of Arab professors, notably those in  Oman, on the integration of artificial intelligence in education. Professors are more  likely to focus on how AI technologies improve learning outcomes and curriculum  delivery than on the practicalities of text recognition. As a result, the omission of  DTRTAIT allowed us to keep the study’s relevance to the target audience and its  practical consequences in an educational setting.  4.1.4. Future research potential  Although DTRTAIT was omitted from our analysis, we acknowledge its  significance for future research. The growth and identification of AI-generated  material will undoubtedly have an influence on educational tools, evaluations, and content validation procedures. We feel that DTRTAIT requires distinct, focused study  to properly appreciate its ramifications, notably in academic integrity and content  verification.  4.2. Discriminant validity  Discriminant validity was further confirmed using criteria proposed by Fornell  and Larcker and the Heterotrait-Monotrait method (HTMT), with results reported in  Tables 3 and 4.

Hypothesis testing  A two-tailed test with a 95% significance level and a t-value of −1.96 was chosen,  as no assumptions were made regarding the sign of the coefficient. This decision was  influenced by the results reported in (Hair, L.D.S. Gabriel, et al., 2019). Table 5 demonstrates the results of the hypothesis, revealing a significant impact of  DV(UGAIT) on IV-SDG (B = 0.221, t = 3.733, p = 0.000) hence, H1 was supported.  DV(DTRTAIT) was removed therefore H2 not applicable for testing. DV(NALOA)  resulted (B = 0.477, t = 7.752, p = 0.000) hence, H3 was supported. DV(PSEPQ)  resulted (B = 0.142, t = 2.645, p = 0.008) hence H4 was supported. A non-significant  impact of DV(ORGIE) on SDG was found (B = 0.058, t = 0.860, p = 0.390) hence, H4  was rejected.
5. Discussion  The growing integration of generative AI in education, exemplified by the  emergence of platforms like ChatGPT, has sparked debates on its implications for the  educational landscape. Diverse viewpoints range from advocating for restricted access  to such technologies until fundamental changes are made in education itself. This  research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of academic expert opinions on the  matter, alongside responses from university administrations and actions taken by  stakeholders, providing a holistic view of the discourse. Focusing on trends in  Generative AI Technologies and sustainable development goals, this study formulates  research questions mapped to independent variables including Use of Generative AI  Technologies (UGAIT), Development of Text Recognition Technologies for AIgenerated Texts (DTRTAIT), New Approaches to Learning Outcome Assessment  (NALOA), Paradigm Shift in Education and Educational Process Organization  (PSEPQ), and Opportunities and Risks of Generative AI in Education (ORGIE).  Sustainable development goals serve as the dependent variable. This study seeks to  explore the relationship between educational technologies and approaches and their  impact on sustainable development goals.  The discussion highlights a significant research gap in the current literature on  Generative AI technologies in education, particularly within the Arab educational  context, such as Oman. While existing studies have explored the transformative  potential, ethical considerations, and impact of AI on educational outcomes, they often  focus on global perspectives or technological advancements, lacking a deep dive into  the cultural and educational specifics of Arab countries. Our study addresses this gap  by offering a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Generative AI technologies on  education in Oman, emphasizing the perspectives and trends among academic experts.  This localized approach bridges the gap between global AI discussions and the unique  educational practices in the Arab world. By exploring how these technologies  influence sustainable development goals in Oman, our research provides insights that  are directly relevant to the region. Moreover, our study contributes empirical data and  analysis on the adoption and effectiveness of AI-driven educational tools in Oman,  enhancing the understanding of how Generative AI can be leveraged to achieve  educational and sustainable development objectives in Arab countries. This work  significantly contributes to the field by offering a much-needed localized perspective,  addressing the intersection of AI, education, and sustainable development within a  specific cultural context. It also offers practical implications for educators,  policymakers, and stakeholders, guiding the responsible and effective integration of  AI in education to advance sustainable development goals in Oman and the broader Arab region.  5.1. Variants of generative AI tools in education  When it comes to the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools for  educational purposes, the disparity between free and commercial versions of  frequently utilized systems such as ChatGPT is an essential aspect to take into  consideration. Basic functionality is provided by the free version, which enables users  to interact with artificial intelligence for the purpose of generating content, learning a  language, and receiving assistance with challenging inquiries. On the other hand,  commercial versions, such as ChatGPT Plus, provide access to more complex artificial  intelligence models, greater regulation, and faster reaction times than the free version.  It is important for educational institutions and teachers who want to use artificial  intelligence for academic reasons to make this distinction. There is a possibility that  paid versions will offer more individually tailored information that is more in line with  academic requirements, as well as enhanced safety features and increased precision.  Furthermore, the regulatory procedures that are incorporated into premium versions  of GAI tools are meant to prevent misuse, which is essential in educational contexts  where the quality and dependability of the information that is created are of the utmost  importance.  The availability of these cutting-edge resources, on the other hand, has the  potential to create a gap in educational equity. Premium artificial intelligence services  may be within the financial means of institutions that have greater resources, while  other institutions may be restricted to free versions, which may have an effect on the  quality of AI-driven learning experiences. This gives rise to more general concerns  over accessibility and the digital divide, particularly in developing nations such as  Oman or other such places. Teachers and policymakers are able to make better  informed judgments on how to effectively integrate artificial intelligence technologies  into learning settings by addressing both free and commercial forms of GAI tools. This  allows them to guarantee that the integration of these technologies is fair and of high  quality across a variety of educational contexts.  5.2.
