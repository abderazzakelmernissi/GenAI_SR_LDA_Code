Introduction
Since the 1980s, the emergence of artificial intelligence in education has signaled a transformative period in the field. It reflects the growing fascination among scholars with the fusion of technology and pedagogy (Sleeman & Brown, 1982). According to contemporary perspectives, artificial intelligence (AI) extends beyond mere technology, encompassing machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and various methods for replicating human cognitive functions (Baker, Smith & Anissa, 2019; Akgun & Greenhow, 2022). Luckin (2017) delved into the potential of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd), emphasizing its capacity to enhance learning outcomes through personalized, flexible, and engaging educational experiences. AIEd not only benefits students but also aids educators in offering tailored support (Dolmark et al., 2021, 2022).

Machine learning, often abbreviated as ML, forms the foundation for both categories of artificial intelligence (AI). When integrated with other technologies, it can augment its capabilities and reduce its dependence on human guidance, as noted by Akgun & Greenhow (2022). ML algorithms have found diverse applications, such as delivering product or service recommendations, recognizing faces, predicting academic performance, and detecting diseases (Kabudi, Pappas & Olsen, 2021; Zhai et al., 2021). Furthermore, Luckin (2017) stresses the significance of AI in real-world learning materials, as it provides assessments, insights into student progress, and addresses achievement gaps. Ultimately, Luckin (2017) assert that the benefits of AI in education outweigh the challenges, making it a worthwhile pursuit.

Various capabilities have gradually evolved in artificial intelligence-driven by machine learning. Among these capabilities is generative AI (GAI), whose roots trace back to the 1960s. However, it was not until approximately 2014 that researchers notably focused on exploring GAI, as Gui et al.’s (2023) research findings underscored. GAI is broadly defined as AI that can generate new content based on input (Pavlik, 2023). Previous studies emphasize the significance of gaining insights into teachers’ viewpoints regarding implementing emerging technologies (Qahl & Sohaib, 2023), as exemplified by extended reality (Kaplan-Rakowski et al., 2023) and virtual reality (Kaplan-Rakowski, Dhimolea & Khukalenko, 2023). However, general artificial intelligence (GAI) integration has received limited attention in the literature, with a few exceptions (Kuleto et al., 2022). Despite the increasing popularity and accessibility of GAI tools, which could be attributed to their relatively recent emergence, there remains a dearth of knowledge concerning teachers’ perceptions of integrating GAI, such as Chat GPT, into educational settings (Celik et al., 2022; Wang, Liu & Tu, 2021). Previous research suggests that the adoption and proliferation of technology heavily hinge upon teachers’ perspectives (Kaplan-Rakowski et al., 2023; Ismail, Almekhlafi & Al-Mekhlafy, 2010). Omitting the initial exploration of teachers’ attitudes towards GAI technology could jeopardize the successful incorporation of such technology in education. Therefore, this study proposes that AI in education (AIEd) can bolster teacher preparedness. Consequently, this research builds upon the work of Kaplan-Rakowski et al. (2023) and is driven by the following research questions:

What are the Saudi educators’ perceptions regarding integrating GAI in the Saudi education system?

Does the level of educator integration with GAI technology significantly predict the frequency of GAI utilization in educational settings?

Literature review
AI in education
As noted by Popenici & Kerr (2017), AI holds the potential to usher in transformative changes within the realm of education. Its capacity to revolutionize both the learning process for students and the teaching methods employed by educational institutions is particularly noteworthy. For example, Georgia Tech in the United States introduced a virtual teaching assistant powered by IBM’s Watson platform, earning acclaim from students (Maderer, 2016). This instance underscores the potential of AI to enhance the teaching process, especially when dealing with student populations and facilitating personalized student interactions. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) field, as highlighted by Schiff (2021), is rapidly evolving to leverage innovative software and hardware tools to enhance the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning. AIEd encompasses a range of application areas, including intelligent tutoring systems, educational agents, adaptive assessments, educational robots, and lifelong intelligent mentors (Schiff, 2021). It is widely believed that modern AIEd has the potential to bridge the quality gaps exposed by previous educational technologies, as it aspires to replicate the role of educators. Through AIEd tools, teachers can shift their focus to higher-level tasks such as curriculum design and assessment while students receive tailored instruction tailored to their needs and learning styles (Schiff, 2021).

Nonetheless, integrating artificial intelligence into the classroom poses several challenges. Researchers have raised ethical concerns regarding data use, algorithm transparency, and potential biases, including worries about data privacy, transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and inherent biases within algorithms (Southgate, Smith & Scevak, 2019; Sohaib & Olszak, 2021; Akgun & Greenhow, 2022). Another significant issue is algorithmic transparency, a known challenge in the AI community, as many AI systems operate as “black boxes,” rendering their decision-making processes inscrutable to humans (Burrell, 2016). The absence of transparency can lead to trust issues for educators and students, mainly if their assessments or recommendations are influenced by AI system decisions (Burrell, 2016). Extensive research on integrating AI into education, as emphasized by Popenici & Kerr (2017), suggests that it can significantly influence the governance and structure of academic institutions.

Furthermore, there are potential risks associated with using AIEd in the classroom, including privacy concerns, biases, and the possibility of technology entirely replacing human educators (Schiff, 2021). Therefore, responsible research is crucial to address these risks, as Schiff (2021) underscores. Integrating social responsibility into processes and cultures is also imperative in addressing these concerns. Additionally, AI can perpetuate biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes stemming from biases in training data and inherent AI biases (Benjamin, 2020). For instance, some AI systems may inadvertently favor students from specific socioeconomic backgrounds, raising equity and fairness concerns in education (Benjamin, 2020).

Consequently, adopting AI in educational settings must be cautiously and carefully considered to mitigate these concerns (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). AI can provide tailored solutions to cater to the support requirements of a diverse range of students (Popenici & Kerr, 2017). Additionally, AIEd aids in fostering learning and helping students overcome challenges related to communication and teamwork, skills vital for their holistic growth (McLaren, Scheuer & Mikšátko, 2010).

Artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) is increasingly recognized as a solution to teaching and learning challenges. One of the educational approaches it offers is individualized tutoring, providing flexibility, personalization, inclusivity, and effectiveness similar to one-on-one instruction (Zanetti, Iseppi & Cassese, 2019). These innovative tools aim to engage students and improve lessons by integrating practical, attentive, and perceptual user interfaces. AIEd tools can even analyze students’ facial expressions and reactions (Chaudhri et al., 2013), a valuable capability, particularly in primary education, where understanding and responding to students’ emotional responses can be beneficial, especially during challenging times (Zanetti, Iseppi & Cassese, 2019). Moreover, AIEd offers intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that simulate a personalized one-on-one tutoring experience, considering learners’ specific needs (McLaren, Scheuer & Mikšátko, 2010). These systems provide activities and feedback, allowing learners some control over their learning process and fostering the development of self-regulation skills (McLaren, Scheuer & Mikšátko, 2010). This is particularly advantageous in education, where nurturing self-regulation skills is an essential learning objective.

In summary, the literature review provides an in-depth exploration of AIEd, offering a comprehensive understanding of its potential benefits and associated challenges. Popenici & Kerr (2017) and Schiff (2021) highlight AI’s transformative capacity in revolutionizing learning and teaching methods, showcasing innovative tools for personalized instruction. Ethical concerns, algorithm transparency challenges, and potential biases are raised by multiple researchers (Southgate, Smith & Scevak, 2019; Sohaib & Olszak, 2021; Akgun & Greenhow, 2022). The need for responsible research and social responsibility integration in AIEd is emphasized by Schiff (2021). McLaren, Scheuer & Mikšátko (2010) and Zanetti, Iseppi & Cassese (2019) underscore the role of AIEd in fostering learning, overcoming challenges, and providing individualized tutoring experiences. Chaudhri et al. (2013) discusses the engaging and perceptual user interfaces of AIEd tools. The literature collectively points to the potential risks and rewards associated with AIEd, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and responsible adoption in educational settings.

Generative AI—what is ChatGPT?
The availability of AI tools like ChatGPT in 2022 has brought AI into the spotlight, making society more aware of its existence and its possible consequences on how we go about our daily activities (Lampropoulos, Ferdig & Kaplan-Rakowski, 2023). Stable Diffusion and DALL-E have enabled the generation of images and videos from text inputs. ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer, is capable of text generation, language translation tasks and summarization. Furthermore, ChatGPT can provide detailed responses to user queries like text and code. The advanced results generated by AI have prompted users to recognize generative AI tools as valuable assistants in problem-solving and content creation. However, they have also voiced apprehensions regarding potentially diminishing human creativity and academic integrity (Ali, 2021; Schiff, 2021; Cope & Kalantzis, 2021; Sharples, 2022).

Methodology
This study employs a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative data collection through surveys and qualitative data collection through interviews to gather insights from educators in Saudi institutions. The Triangulation Design, depicted in Fig. 1, is the most prevalent and widely recognized approach to integrating research methods (Creswell et al., 2003).

Quantitative method
This study utilized an online survey instrument partially derived from a previously validated survey developed by Kaplan-Rakowski et al. (2023) and Wozney, Venkatesh & Abrami (2006). Participants were required first to review and acknowledge the consent form, confirming their eligibility as educators who had utilized ChatGPT at least once. Initially, participants were tasked with selecting the technology integration stage (out of six options: awareness, learning, understanding, familiarity, adaptation, and creative application) that best described their progression with general artificial intelligence (GAI). Following this, participants were required to rate their level of agreement, using a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree), in response to statements related to their perceptions of GAI implementation in education. To suit the specific context of this study on GAI technology, 15 items and certain statements were adapted from Kaplan-Rakowski et al. (2023) and Wozney, Venkatesh & Abrami (2006).

Also, experts in Saudi higher education specializing in educational technology assessed and provided feedback on the survey items’ operationalization. After making necessary revisions based on their input, the expert panel confirmed the instrument’s content validity. In evaluating generative AI integration in Saudi Arabian education, participants were systematically chosen and recruited to ensure a representative sample reflective of the targeted educational context. The recruitment process involved reaching out to educators within Saudi higher institutions through collaboration with educational authorities and institutions. The specific criteria for determining participation eligibility included individuals actively engaged in teaching roles within Saudi higher education settings. This criterion aimed to capture insights from educators directly involved in the learning and instructional processes impacted by generative AI integration.

Additionally, participants were required to have a minimum level of familiarity with AI technologies to provide meaningful perspectives on the subject matter. A total of 140 participants responded to the survey. The participants were educators in Saudi higher institutions. After removing incomplete or missing data, 125 were used for the analysis.

Qualitative method
A thorough and nuanced research approach is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence (AI) in education (AIEd) is implemented in the Saudi education system. This study employs the qualitative phenomenological method in our study, a method recommended by Creswell in 2003, which delves into individuals’ experiences and perceptions (Creswell et al., 2003). This study uses a qualitative phenomenological approach to uncover the intricate layers of experiences and perceptions held by primary school teachers in Saudi concerning the incorporation of AIEd into their teaching practices. More specifically, this study employed the thematic analysis method alongside the phenomenological approach. This combination helps us carefully scrutinize the data we have collected during our research. The thematic analysis enables us to explore, identify, articulate, and structure the underlying themes and patterns within our data, as suggested by Nowell et al. (2017).

In this study, qualitative data was collected by conducting detailed interviews with three experienced educators in higher education in Saudi Arabia, referred to as P1, P2, and P3. This study gathered qualitative data through in-depth interviews with three highly experienced educators in Saudi Arabia, identified as P1, P2, and P3, all holding Ph.D. degrees and offering diverse perspectives from their respective specializations in higher education. P1 brings expertise in education technology, P2 contributes insights from computer science, and P3, a recognized leader in the academic community, offers perspectives on engineering. These educators were selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implications of Generative AI integration in Saudi Arabian higher education, bringing a wealth of knowledge and diverse experiences to enrich the study’s qualitative findings. Our goal with these interviews was to gain insight into educators’ perspectives, observations, and insights regarding integrating artificial intelligence in education. The interviews were carried out in the English language and were meticulously transcribed verbatim to facilitate further analysis.

Discussions
Quantitative insights
With the integration of AI, the educational landscape is on the brink of a significant transformation characterized by enhancing personalized learning experiences and automating administrative tasks (Southgate, Smith & Scevak, 2019; Zulkarnain & Yunus, 2023). It is essential to recognize that AI holds substantial potential in bridging achievement gaps and furnishing students and educators with customized support that aligns with their specific requirements (Luckin, 2017). However, it is imperative to acknowledge the existence of challenges and apprehensions alongside these promising prospects, which necessitate attention. Among the vital areas that educators and policymakers must contend with are ethics, data privacy, and the imperative need for effective collaboration with artificial intelligence (Akgun & Greenhow, 2022). As we advance in integrating AI into education, it is crucial to exercise caution, ensuring that the advantages of AI are fully harnessed while conscientiously addressing any potential challenges (Kang, Li & Sohaib, 2023; Alammari, Sohaib & Younes, 2022; Baker, Smith & Anissa, 2019).

Academics’ favorable stance toward GAI contradicts specific research findings on incorporating technology in education. A systematic review conducted by Celik et al. (2022) indicated that educators typically need more support to adopt emerging technologies in their teaching due to the complex nature and wide variety of these new tools. The contrasting outcomes observed in our present study may be attributed to the fact that ChatGPT faces fewer external obstacles. Notably, over 50% of the participants we surveyed had gained some experience with ChatGPT in less than 6 months after its launch in November 2022 (Lampropoulos, Ferdig & Kaplan-Rakowski, 2023). Furthermore, the rapid rise and widespread adoption of ChatGPT have motivated educators to closely evaluate this AI tool, as noted by Firat (2023) and Lampropoulos, Ferdig & Kaplan-Rakowski (2023). The frequent media coverage of ChatGPT and other AI tools, along with their swift progress, may lead to increased utilization and integration by educators.

The findings suggest a positive connection between teachers’ awareness of GAI and their usage, aligning with the research of Kaplan-Rakowski and others in 2023. This correlation supports prior research emphasizing the link between teachers’ exposure to AI, their trust in the technology (as demonstrated by Nazaretsky et al. (2022)), and their willingness to incorporate AI into their teaching practices (as shown by Kuleto et al. (2022)). The findings also showed that most participants already contemplate specific AI applications (representing the understanding stage) or feel comfortable using AI (reflecting the familiarity stage), increasing awareness and utilization. It’s reasonable to expect a shift towards greater integration levels over time, specifically in the adaptation and creative application stages.

Teachers’ perceptions of AI support the reported understanding and familiarity stages of integration as an instructional tool and their expectations of easy implementation. In these stages, teachers actively consider how to confidently employ GAI for specific tasks. The perceived value and comfort of integrating GAI, like ChatGPT, into educational settings contribute to the positive attitudes observed. ChatGPT is web-based and easily accessible through account creation without additional equipment. It appears that teachers are ready to embrace GAI, which is a welcome departure from earlier studies where teachers often expressed unpreparedness for AI integration, as found in the studies by An et al. (2022), Alharbi & Sohaib (2021), Celik et al. (2022) and Nazaretsky et al. (2022).

The study reveals that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) holds transformative educational potential, offering personalized learning experiences and streamlining administrative tasks. Policymakers and educators should acknowledge the positive impact and address ethical, data privacy, and practical collaboration challenges. The link between teachers’ awareness and usage of GAI suggests a promising trend for integration, requiring supportive policies.

Approximately half of the surveyed educators already find themselves at the understanding and familiarity stages of GAI integration, suggesting a readiness for its adoption. Moreover, the perceived value and ease of GAI assimilation among educators encouraged and likely to incorporate GAI into their teaching methods. GAI tools’ user-friendly and web-based nature, like ChatGPT, enhances their accessibility and implementation.

The qualitative analysis of interview responses complements the quantitative findings by offering a deeper understanding of individual experiences and perceptions. These interviews revealed a diversity of viewpoints and experiences among educators. While some, like P1, expressed optimism and enthusiasm for GAI’s potential in enhancing academic achievement, others, like P2, approached the technology cautiously, recognizing its benefits but emphasizing potential drawbacks. P3 highlighted the need to balance traditional and AI-based resources and expressed concerns about students needing to catch up on GAI. Notably, the interviews unveiled a range of experiences, from GAI serving as a catalyst for collaborative learning to fostering professional growth, as emphasized by P2.

In conclusion, the convergence of quantitative and qualitative findings underscores the complex and evolving landscape of GAI integration in education. While quantitative data reveal the trends in awareness and adoption, qualitative insights emphasize individual nuances and concerns. GAI offers promising opportunities for improving academic achievement, fostering collaboration, and encouraging professional development among educators. However, challenges such as potential overreliance, plagiarism concerns, and the need for a balanced approach have also come to the fore. The results highlight the importance of careful consideration and ongoing research to strike the right balance in harnessing GAI’s potential in education. Ultimately, the findings suggest that educators are ready to embrace GAI, but it is essential to navigate this integration thoughtfully, recognizing the duality of its impact on teaching and learning.
