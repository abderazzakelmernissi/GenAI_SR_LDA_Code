The stated problem of enhancing education using generative artificial intelligence tools in a practical approach directly relates to the research question: “How can education be enhanced using generative artificial intelligence tools in a practical approach, applying the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix?” 4PADAFE [4] stands for Academic Project, Strategic Plan, Instructional Planning, Instructional Material Production (4P), Teaching Action (AD), Formative Adjustments (AF), and Evaluation (E). The research question seeks to specifically inquire into the possibilities and benefits of generative artificial intelligence tools, combined with the 4PADAFE matrix, to enhance the teaching–learning process. The aim is to explore how these tools can personalize learning, provide immediate feedback, adapt educational materials, and promote the development of key skills in students. By analyzing and evaluating the potential of these tools in a practical approach, we seek to identify effective strategies for their implementation in education to optimize the student experience and strengthen the quality of education in a digitalized and constantly evolving environment.
Another problem is the lack of knowledge on the part of teachers of generative artificial intelligence tools and systematic processes for designing micro-curricular activities that guide the development and construction of massive virtual learning classrooms; this would enable teachers to manage activities and design digital resources with artificial intelligence with innovative educational strategies that facilitate the creation of massive virtual classrooms [1].
The general objective of this research has been to analyze and evaluate the potential of generative artificial intelligence tools in the educational context, focusing on the practical application of the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix.
Based on the stated objectives, the proposed scientific or working hypothesis to be contrasted or demonstrated in this study is that applying generative artificial intelligence tools in the educational environment, using the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix, positively impacts the teaching–learning process.
Based on the statement above, this combination of tools and practical approach is expected to improve academic results and student engagement in learning, promoting more efficient, effective, and personalized education.
The present study shows the results of the implementation of the 4PADAFE methodology; during the development of the course “Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools for Education. ChatGPT Techniques”, teachers were given the task of designing a teaching unit using both the generative artificial intelligence tools (IAG) learned in the course and the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix.
In practice, the teachers demonstrated a solid understanding and application of the 4PADAFE methodology and the generative artificial intelligence tools. First, they conducted detailed planning, identifying the specific learning objectives they wanted to achieve in their teaching unit. From there, they designed micro-curricular activities that aligned with the principles of the 4PADAFE matrix.
The activities proposed by the teachers involved using IAG tools at different stages of the educational process. For example, they designed initial activities that took advantage of the content generation capabilities of IAG tools to present the contents of a subject attractively. They also designed interactive activities where students interacted with different IAG tools such as chatPDF.com, You.com, chatbots, and virtual assistants to solve problems, receive feedback, or explore new ideas.
In addition, teachers used IAG tools to evaluate student performance more efficiently and effectively. These tools allowed them to analyze student-generated responses, assess comprehension, and provide real-time personalized feedback.
In summary, the teachers demonstrated a solid command of the 4PADAFE methodology and generative artificial intelligence tools. They planned and designed their micro-curricular activities effectively using IAG tools, leveraging their capabilities to enhance content presentation, promote student–teacher interaction, and streamline learning assessment. These combined approaches resulted in dynamic and enriching teaching units that fostered active student participation and facilitated the achievement of the learning objectives.
In conclusion, current technological educational trends emphasize the use of generative artificial intelligence tools, which allow the creation of personalized educational content tailored to the needs of students. In addition, implementing an instructional design matrix provides a structured guide for developing micro-curricular activities, ensuring coherence and quality in the educational process.
On the other hand, implementing an instructional design matrix in the educational process has become a fundamental practice to guarantee quality and coherence in the design of co-curricular activities. An instructional design matrix provides a structure and a clear guide for the development of the activities, considering the educational objectives, the contents, the teaching strategies, the evaluations, and the necessary resources. By following an instructional design matrix, educators can ensure that activities align with learning objectives and promote an effective and meaningful educational process [4].
The evolution of generative artificial intelligence raises the need to reconsider the teaching–learning process since its impact extends to the trend of adaptive education. This trend can potentially have a significant impact on conventional learning approaches.

Creating a virtual classroom within a virtual learning environment involves following the instructional design matrix described in Figure 5. The matrix emphasizes the importance of strategic planning (Phase 2), instructional planning (Phase 3), teaching actions (Phase 5), and evaluation (Phase 6).
Phase 2 focuses on developing micro-curricular planning for each unit, including defining competencies, objectives, contents, and learning outcomes every week. Phase 3 builds upon Phase 2 and involves creating study materials using digital resources, interactive multimedia technologies, and virtual learning environments. Synchronous and asynchronous learning activities are planned, with the learning organization determined by the number of hours allocated to the teaching component (CD), application and experimentation practices (CPA), and autonomous learning (CAA).
CD’s teaching component encompasses direct teacher interaction, collaborative learning activities, video lectures, forums, discussions, joint exercises, and feedback. Digital resources such as videos, videoconferences, podcasts, presentations, concept maps, and digital books are utilized. The application and experimentation practices component involves practical or laboratory activities complementing the study material. Autonomous learning consists of activities independently developed by students under teacher guidance. These components lead to Phase 5, where integrative activities or final products are proposed to achieve the training objectives. Phase 4 involves designing didactic materials based on micro-curricular planning, while Phase 6 defines the number of assessments per week.
Various educational resources can be employed to enhance student learning, including audiovisual materials, which should be concise (no longer than 5 min), with high image and sound quality, and accompanied by a well-developed script. Combining different types of educational resources can increase student interest and motivation. It is essential to ensure compliance with accessibility requirements and creative commons licenses for these resources.
In online training, teachers fulfill new roles supported by generative artificial intelligence and digital strategies. This methodology includes using digital tools and resources to design engaging educational materials, conducting synchronous and asynchronous tutoring sessions, facilitating academic forums, providing guidance on technology usage, monitoring the learning process, evaluating student progress, and providing feedback.

In addition, technical limitations are also a factor to consider; although generative artificial intelligence tools have made significant progress in generating coherent and relevant content, they can still present difficulties in understanding complex contexts or interpreting abstract concepts. This can affect the quality and accuracy of the answers generated, which requires teacher supervision and correction to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to students.
Another aspect to consider is the over-reliance on generative artificial intelligence tools. While these tools can help provide additional support and facilitate the teaching process, there is a risk that students may become overly dependent on them and fail to develop critical skills, such as problem-solving or critical thinking. Balancing these tools with pedagogical approaches that foster students’ holistic development is essential.
Applying generative artificial intelligence tools and implementing the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix is crucial for building massive virtual MOOC classrooms. These educational technology trends offer new opportunities to personalize learning, adapt to individual learner needs, and improve the quality of educational content. Generative artificial intelligence tools enable the automated creation of personalized educational materials, while the instructional design matrix provides structured guidance for designing and planning micro-curricular activities. These technology trends are especially relevant in massive MOOC virtual classrooms that seek to reach many students. Generative artificial intelligence and the instructional design matrix make it possible to efficiently manage and organize educational content, tailoring it to the needs of a diverse audience. Teachers can use generative artificial intelligence tools to improve student engagement and motivation by providing relevant content tailored to their preferences and learning styles. Implementing the instructional design matrix ensures consistency and quality in the design of the activities, aligning them with the educational objectives and providing a clear structure for performance.
One limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size of 42 teachers. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to larger populations. Future research could consider expanding the sample size to include a more diverse range of participants from different regions and academic disciplines to enhance the generalizability of the results.
Another limitation is the focus on specific generative artificial intelligence tools and instructional design matrices. Other tools and methodologies not included in our study may be available. Future research could explore a broader range of tools and methodologies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their impact in virtual classrooms.
To gain deeper insights into teachers’ experiences and perceptions, future research could incorporate qualitative data such as interviews or open-ended survey questions. This would provide a richer understanding of how teachers incorporate generative AI tools in their teaching methods, specific tasks or interactions facilitated by these tools, and any observed benefits or challenges.
Conducting longitudinal studies over an extended period could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the long-term effects and sustainability of using generative AI tools and instructional design matrices in virtual classrooms.
Including comparison groups of teachers who do not use generative AI tools or instructional design matrices would allow for a more rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of these tools on student engagement, learning outcomes, and overall educational experience.
By addressing these limitations and exploring additional avenues for research, we can further refine our understanding of the potential of generative AI tools and instructional design matrices in education and identify strategies to optimize their implementation and effectiveness.
Finally, generative artificial intelligence tools facilitate the initial development of ideas and reflection on them, favoring the generation of creative and innovative solutions. Similarly, automated assessment and other assessment innovations enable more accurate and objective tracking of student progress, provide immediate feedback, and support data-driven decision-making by teachers.
